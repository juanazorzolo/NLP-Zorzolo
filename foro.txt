Can someone explain to me how this game is number one in the family game rankings?

Can someone explain to me how this game is number one in the family game rankings?

Short answer: because it has the highest rank among family games.
Longer answer: see
Ratings
for more info about this sort of question.
PS: are you asking why it's highly ranked? Or why it's classed a family game? (The latter is due to user
Subdomain
votes.)

Can someone explain to me how this game is number one in the family game rankings?

I think in short because of the bias of the BGG community as a whole towards heavier games.
I would not consider it a family/gateway game at all, but enough do for it to be classed as such.

It’s on the same level as everdell and wingspan complexity-wise as far as games in the top 5. It’s obvious this user driven category is not including only gateway-type games. But also the next level up from gateway where the theme draws people in and they can learn to appreciate some of the deeper mechanisms in board games. Also, where the theme can be appreciated by the young and old without controversy.
Lastly, I think some people interpret family as it must be low complexity enough to support the very young (7 and under) and I don’t know that that is a necessity. Something like chutes and ladders or candy land.  I would consider a game that teenagers and their parents can play together as a family game and it does not need to bore hobby gamers (like a lot of gateway games do.)
Given those points, Arnak seems perfectly appropriate for top family game.

Scanning the family list it seems like the most complex game on that list by a significant margin, but yeah, the lesson is that you shouldn't look at either ranking or categorization uncritically.

i thought it was a bug
. thank you all

It started in the family category, then popped up in strategy. Pleased to see it's back where it belongs. Its an amazing family game. Why Sky Team is in Family is beyond me though......!

It is a great game to play with the family.

Finally, the game has disappeared from the top of family gamesl. It is no longer even mentioned. A bug? maybe…

Not a bug. As I already mentioned upthread, a game's subdomain is determined by the game's user poll about its subdomain. Currently Arnak's poll results have it only in the Strategy subdomain.

How does one vote on category?

We love the original game and played through all the leaders and campaign and we have loved every minute of it. These days, our tastes and attention span are changing and we're really leaning towards easy set up and ~one hour games. I wouldn't say Arnak is bloated but it's an endeavor to get it to the table compared with so many other excellent smaller box games that have been coming out in the last couple years.
So please please please!!!!! Duel or duo version PLEASE!!!!!

Can't say I'm against this idea. I absolutely adore Arnak, I own every promo, expansion, deluxe components, I have the box signed by the authors. I consider it one of the best crafted and polished boardgames of this generation.
But it's soooo damn hard to table due to its length, size and setup time. We got to the point where my girlfriend actaully gives me Arnak plays as gifts for birthdays/namedays/Christmas, because with her gaming preferences leaning towards casual/family games, Arnak is simply too long and repetitive for her to pick over games like Harmonies, Wingspan, Faraway etc.

A good insert reduces setup time.

I'm out of the loop. Would someone explain to me how this would differ from the standard game with 2 players?

A good insert reduces setup time.

I have one of the best inserts on the market. Even if the setup takes 8 minutes, that's 7 minutes longer than let's say Vale of Eternity. Setup is the least of my concerns though. The length and sheer size of the game is what makes it hard to pull out any time we want to play something or put it in a bag and go to a friend's house.
Arnak is simply not a medium-size family/filler type of game, even though the gameplay itself would fit within that genre. That's why a shorter, smaller, more condensed version of the game with most of the same concepts and theme might be interesting for some people. I know I'd buy it and probably play it way more than the base game.

I'm out of the loop. Would someone explain to me how this would differ from the standard game with 2 players?

I think they mean a "duel version" that is a smaller shorter simplified version for specifically 2 players.
(FWIW I see "smaller shorter simplified" and "specifically for 2 players" as 2 separate independent things.)

It doesn't necessarily need to be 2P only. Just smaller, shorter, streamlined. Something like Terraforming Mars tried with Ares Expedition. Just done better.

Honestly, I have no idea how this game could be more streamlined (base game of course).
Place a worker and grab some resources, pay resources to take a step forward in the temple, pay resources to overcome a guardian, buy a card, play a card from your hand, ... that's basically it. And there's very few maintenance between the rounds: shuffle your deck, rearrange the card market, take your workers back to your supply ....
Plus, with 2 players it's already quite fast. There are basically less places to send a worker to compared to a game with 4 playes, where each tent side has two places and there are generally more level I and II sites revealed.
No comparison to Terraforming Mars, where you draw completely new cards from a shared deck every round and have to decide which ones to buy (or draft), no production phase and stuff like that.

I'm really sick of the current trending of making duo versions of everything, even if the original one works wonders with two players.

Why would that make you sick? No one forces you to buy a duo version of any game.

I'm curious why you are so sick of this trend? If they don't interest you, just move along.
I think scaled-down versions of bigger games for couples who want a shorter and lighter experience is a huge market. A market to which I belong and I will pretty much buy any duo/duel game that comes out. Imagine a game that is 60-70% of the experience of LRoA that you can set up in 2 minutes. That's what I mean. Like a 2-player travel version...

Exactly. Anyone saying how they can't imagine the game being any simpler and smaller are simply shortsighted and think everyone has to share their views and experiences. This thread alone proves there's a huge market for it. As I said earlier, I love the theme and mechanics of Arnak, but I can't convinvce my girlfriend to play it unless it's my birthday. There's simply too many choices for her to choose from. Make it 4 rounds instead of 5, make the market smaller and the research track shorter. Those are the most obvious changes. Then there's more drastic ones like removing one type of resource, one type of travel icon (there really is no need for having both car and boat on the middle level, the only purpose is higher difficulty) or perhaps removing all the statues. There are many ways to make the game simpler without hurting the exploring/archeology theme too much.

8 mins? I have done my own insert with foamcore and I can't get it ready in 2 mins tops! you sure you but the right stuff?

You can play in BGA to scratch the itch

I play with the wife 90% of the time the original + Leaders, we played the campaign and it was preatty god, it was meant as a DUO, have you explored it? (Arnak: the missing expedition)
I would say we can make 60/70 games most of the time!

I actually consider most "duel" version better than the originals. Splendor Duel, 7 Wonders Duel, Codenames Duet, Everdell Duo, these are all much more polished and dynamic versions of the games. Wingspan Asia isn't necessarily better, because it's mechanically the same, but it's definitely a much better deal. It includes all the expansions at third of the price. I can't wait to try the upcoming Azul Duel, as it seems so much more complex and interactive than just Azul at 2P, and also Isle of Cats duel seems like a great idea, because one of the core aspects of the original game, that takes up most time, is drafting, which is pretty much pointless at 2 players as the stakes of losing several valuable cards are much lower.

8 mins? I have done my own insert with foamcore and I can't get it ready in 2 mins tops! you sure you but the right stuff?

Stop being so cocky. 8 minutes was a random number I just came up with. I never measured how long do game setups take and I don't even care. I just know that without the insert (which is one of the highest rated 3D inserts on Etsy) the setup would take twice as long. I playtest and review about 200 different games a year. Which means there's usually about 50+ different rulebooks I go through between any two plays of Arnak. I just can't remember where every tiny little piece goes without checking the rulebook every now and then.

I think the main takeaway is that there are inherent differences between player counts, and the difference between 2p and 3p+ is particularly significant. I find it unsurprising that a game expressly designed for 2p will often be a superior experience versus playing a game at 2p that is predominantly designed for 3-4p, as many (most?) games are.

Hello! What are the differences between all the Temples? Both sites and research track (also considering the expansions Maps).
I am a new player of Arnak (loving It!) and today I did my First gameplay on Snake Temple: my feeling was that in the Bird Temple It Is more of a race to be the First to arrive at the top of the track, while the snake Temple let me Explore more the map. Is this feeling generally correct? And what are the feeling a of the expansions Maps (that in the near future I Will buy)?

these may help:

Welcome! Here on BGG, every game has its own forums, and it's best to post in the right forum to get answers to your question. You're looking for this one:

.
But,
don't delete this thread!
(It won't work anyhow, you can't  delete anything except your own posts.) Just click the three dots at the top and choose "Wrong Forum", and a mod will be along soon to move it to the right place.

As DC said, you should probably get this moved to the right forum however to answer your question, the main difference is difficulty.
The Snake Temple is intended to be slightly harder than the Bird temple. You get fewer free compasses from the temple track and the total resource costs are slightly higher. The one that requires you to give up a totem is the most obvious but the resource costs are also slightly higher on the Snake Temple. So this actually makes it harder to explore on the Snake map since you don't have as many extra compasses to pay for that. If exploring felt easier it was probably because you had a better feel for the flow of the game and how to get the compasses that you need for exploration without relying on the free ones from the temple.
The expansion temples are intended to be a bit harder/more expensive than the Snake Temple as well since they assume that you are playing with the new captains so you have a stronger starting deck and other special abilities that will result in you generating more resources during the course of the game.

Greetings Doudo--
To get some better answers for you, and as the other users have suggested, I have moved your post to the

Lost Ruins of Arnak

forums, which are on the page for the

Lost Ruins of Arnak

game.  Each game and expansion in our database has its own page, searchable from the large search box in the upper right corner of your screen, and those pages include forums to use to discuss issues specific to that game. When you reach the game's main page, look for the toolbar below the stars where you rate the game to find the option for "Forums" and click on that to find them.
Now that your question is in the "specialized" forum devoted to just the one game, you will be more likely to get answers from players who are interested in the game and hang out there.
Happy gaming!

I want to buy the new expansions but i wanted to know if the new asymmetric leaders are strictly better than the normal one in the base game? Are they making the game easier in solo mode?

In the strictest possible reading of "strictly better" only some of the leaders is better than the default, while some have things that are a relative downside - but in practice they are all better overall than playing without a leader by a decent margin.
This is somewhat offset by the new temples included, which are more expensive to climb (and this doesn't apply to the solo rival, so a degree of balance can be maintained there).
There are also more advanced purple rival tiles available online to use for print and play or with a web-app which allow the rival to do better (with or without this expansion) which can be used to offset leader power if you want.

The leader powers make the game more interesting. While not an Arnak veteran, I didn't find the leader abilities making the solo game easier to win. Perhaps slightly, but not a significant jump.
As Simon noted, the purple tiles that can be printed out would offer an increase in difficulty. I also thought I read the tiles would be included in the new expansion, but I may be misremembering.

The base game is excellent! If you have tired of it, then yes:
Leaders
is a very good expansion.
If you're looking to add an item to your Christmas list that you wouldn't buy for yourself, then
Leaders
is a decent choice!
In multiplayer games, leaning into your leader's abilities ends up putting players into swim lanes: favoring different parts of the game that reduce (but not eliminate) player competition for spaces. All the usual caveats apply: you don't have to do that, it's not always the best option, yadda, yadda. But I have found when I get into a situation where I haven't already determined a clear set of actions, that defaulting to whatever advances my leader's abilities is a good choice.
Leaders
has reduced the amount of time spent analyzing the game state.
For me, that is. If you want to analyze everything including your leader's abilities, then it will increase the time spent analyzing your position. YMMV.
For the solo missions, some feel like they were tailored for a specific leader; this makes them easier. Conversely, if you want more of a challenge then try winning with a different leader. That will be harder. Both experiences are there for you.
If, after all that, you're not convinced to buy it for yourself then throw it on your Christmas list and hope for the best. It seems you like the base game enough that you will get some enjoyment out of
Leaders
and be glad that someone else paid for it. But if the idea that someone might not get it for you and you still won't have it irritates you, then you already have your answer!

I want to buy the new expansions but i wanted to know if the new asymmetric leaders are strictly better than

There are no leaders in the base game. The leaders in both expansions give asymmetric powers, which you like or not.
My wife doesn't like them, I don't care to play with or without a leader.

As Simon noted, the purple tiles that can be printed out would offer an increase in difficulty. I also thought I read the tiles would be included in the new expansion, but I may be misremembering.

Nope. The purple tiles  are not included in

nor in

.
Next year there will be a third expansion with a new double sided (and 50% bigger) game board, which will be sold in a "Big Box". I do not have information what other components will be added besides "Dark Tablets". So still no information if the purple tiles are added. The big box can hold base game and all expansions and promo's.
These pictures were taken during SPIEL'24 where the designers are showing the (almost) final front side of the game board. The back side is still in development.



I want to buy the new expansions but i wanted to know if the new asymmetric leaders are strictly better than the normal one in the base game? Are they making the game easier in solo mode?

They are strictly better. As mentioned, the Leaders expansion also includes two new temple tracks that are meant to offset this.
(Note that the free online solo campaign also mentions this: It's been designed to be played without leaders; otherwise it's too easy.)
Frankly, base game solo mode is already so easy, it doesn't make any difference if you're using a leader or not.
I'm still at a 100% win rate after 16 plays using 2 purple tiles (and 3 red tiles) for all but my two first solo plays, so I would definitely recommend to print and use the purple advanced tiles (or use the web app).

I played my third game last night with a full group of four players. The first two plays were at 3-player.
One of our players was saying -- and I don't disagree based on my limited experience -- that this is simply a multiplayer solitaire game, as there is little to no interaction. Sure there is a moment, albeit brief, where someone fills a spot I needed, but other than that we were each playing our own game.
Am I missing something?
I do have the Leader's expansion. Will this help?

The interaction of blocking and similar stuff like buying a card someone else wanted is certainly more than just a "brief moment"; I would say that it's very frequent and often significantly impacts what other players can do.  It's certainly not "multiplayer solitaire" -- a player who plays heads-down oblivious to what opponents are doing will do worse.
But if you don't subjectively feel that as
interesting
interaction, then sure, the game does not have the kind of interaction you are interested in. It's not like a combat game where you directly attack each other, for example, or a game where you steal resources from each other.

You're not missing anything. Its a very good fun medium euro with the usual kinds of light euro interaction. Lots of people like this type of game including me, but no it's not heavy on interaction. That isn't it's appeal. I mean it's not as if there's no interaction, to play well you need to be looking at what other players are doing, but it sounds like you want a different kind of game.
If you are looking for a game with lots of interaction this game is not for you, the expansions will not change that.

There's tons of interaction in blocking and beating players to things, but you won't be actively hurting people or taking things from them directly. Tempo is everything in this game. There are multiple things you want to do at any time, but what order you do them in hugely matters so that other players don't beat you to it (whether that be a reward on the track, buying a card you wanted, taking a worker spot you wanted. etc...). To play even half decently, you absolutely have to be paying close attention to what the other players are doing at all times. I actually assumed this was a joke post when I saw the headline. This game is absolutely nowhere near multiplayer solitaire.

I've seen this described in several other threads as
direct
versus
indirect
interaction, and I think it's a fine distinction.
I agree with Russ and Ryan - there's a whole lot of decision space in Arnak that's very intentionally about what the other players are doing or may want to do. Blocking spaces, buying cards, claiming assistants, etc. are all actions that can simultaneously help you and hinder other players, which is fully indirect interaction.
I think the real key here (and in many games with indirect interaction that get labeled as 'multiplayer solitaire') is if you're really playing totally head-down in your own silo, you'll lose to a player who takes a moment to get in your way once or twice.

There are some players who i think want a games mechanics to actively create engagement between players (combat is an obviously example), rather than something that happens between players competing for points. Im not quite sure why they buy these kinds of euro games.

All the feedback is helpful.
Watching what others are doing, in order to determine my moves, is something I'll need to grow in.
I'm still working on what I see in front of me on my board, explorers, assistance, and cards. I'm so new to the game that watching others is barely on my radar, since there are so many 'good' decisions each round with what is available to me.
Thanks again, everyone.

I expect for this one at least the theme might leave them to believe it is other than it is. Like they see the "Indiana Jones" type theme, see it's highly rated, and just think this is going to be a story driven interactive game where you are fighting other treasure hunters. On the other end of the spectrum you've got stuff like Hansa Teutonica and Age of Steam which if you didn't know anything about them look like low interaction cube placement games, but are in fact extremely interactive and cut throat.

Hi Rich,
I have to disagree on something here, the interaction in the co-op campaign is super high, its practically impossible to not discuss with your partner on every single turn and succeed.

not sure if you are looking for a co-op experience but what I say above is not subjective.
For the actual competitive game though I agree, regardless of wether you have the leaders expansion or not the player interaction in this game is purely "take-that" - it's about buying cards or claiming/blocking locations before your opponent can get to them. Since the research track is such an important element of the game particularly for end game points then stopping an opponent from getting resources they need to advance is key to interaction in that sense.
Warm regards,
Andy

Man I dunno, competition for those premium spots that come out is hot. And even in the beginning, blocking off the basic campsite spaces with the wave tiles really tightens up the game. Even the two player game is super tight resource wise, especially in the beginning. Every card acquisition and worker placement means something. Your plan will have to shift if you were totally dependent on obtaining one specific card, and your opponent picks it up before you do.
This is the kind of interaction I like. I do not like someone stealing or depleting my resources— I can spend my resources poorly enough on my own, thank you very much.

Whilst i haven't played co-op, from what I've seen yes I completely agree. My comment was only meant to be about the competitive game.

No problem.
I would say for many if these games, your first game will be focussed on what you're doing and getting to know all the interactions mechanically. But on subsequent plays, that's when you start not just playing the game but playing your opponents too.

Hi!
I just wondering if I play Saxophone card as a main action and I use card's travel value. Can I use other symbol to travel location what needs boat symbol to enter and other symbol to assistant who needs car symbol for it's free action?
Thanks

It would be helpful if you stated what the main action of the Saxophone card is.  Otherwise you're expecting us to either know all the cards by heart, or to go pull out our copies and dig through it for the card.  Does the card give you travel symbols?  Because I thought at first you were asking about playing a card for its main action and also using its travel value (which isn't allowed).

Card in question.
If you're asking if you use one symbol for main action (travelling to level one site for example) and then another symbol for free action (activating an assistant or the lighting bolt sign on it)  then that's a yes. Symbols are valid for the whole turn NOT round

EDIT: I mis-read the initial question (personally I talk about spending cards for their travel symbols and only use 'play' to refer to using them for their text, but that might be a carry over from the Arkham Horror Card Game where 'playing' and 'committing' are crucially different and often confusing).  My answer below is accurate for playing Saxophone for its text, but not helpful for the actual question about just spending the card to generate travel costs for a Dig action and having left-overs.  That question is well answered by AAbouzeid above.
Playing Saxophone is your main action for the round. That means you don't have another main action. Therefore, if some of the assistants on the supply board give you travel icons then those can only be spent on free actions (or the other assistants as part of the Saxophone main action). You cannot use them to take a Dig or Discover main action.

Hi!
I just wondering if I play Saxophone card as a main action and I use card's travel value.

I may be misunderstanding what you mean, but if you play a card for its action, then you cannot also use the card for its travel value e.g. to do a dig action (unless the card's action explicitly lets you). See page 8: play a card (for its action) is a different main action from dig or discover.

OP is playing the card for its travel icons: one ship and one car. If OP travels to a site requiring a ship, can OP use the other travel symbol (the car) in lieu of a boot to carry out a “free turn” assistant action (using an assistant already owned) to trade the boot (or, here, the car) for the arrowhead depicted on the assistant tile?
In other words, can the two travel icons on this card be split between a main action and a free action?
Edit: I don’t know the answer to this!

Yup, I probably didn't help because I mis-understood the initial question and started answering other things after a perfectly good answer had been provided.  I've edited my response above to try and focus on the answer to the actual question.

Aha! Thanks. This may occasionally allow the second icon to be used productively rather than wasted.

OP is playing the card for its travel icons: one ship and one car.

FWIW if that's what OP meant, then OP is not playing the card "as a main action". OP is doing something else "as a main action" (e.g. dig or discover, perhaps?) and is playing the card "for its travel value". (See page 8.)

(personally I talk about spending cards for their travel symbols and only use 'play' to refer to using them for their text, but that might be a carry over from the Arkham Horror Card Game ...

Well, you use the proper wordings: "play" and "spend" as per the Lost Ruins of Arnak base game rules:

Rulebook, page 13

To
Play a Card
1.
Play the card
from your hand face up into your play area.
2.
Resolve the card’s effect
.

Rulebook, page 9

Paying Travel Costs
As you would expect, you can
pay a cost
of [boot]
by spending a card
with the [boot] icon – take the card from your hand, and put it face up into your play area, ignoring its effect.

After purchasing the expansion I was really happy to see that I have 2 more extra temples to play with, increasing the variability. Then I realized, these 2 temples are not additions, but replacements as the base game temples are too easy to play with the leaders. I would prefer if the game had 4 viable temples, but I also don't want to mess up the delicate balance.
I think increasing the difficulty of the base game temples would not be that hard to do, and I am considering to add some extra costs to the steps. However, I am sure that I am not the first one that came up with the idea so wanted to ask here first about any similar attempts and your degrees of successes with such an approach.

This doesn't answer your question, but an alternative way of obtaining the two additional temples that you are seeking would be to buy

, which has two new and arguably even more challenging research tracks.

Yeah but then I will be having 4 temples, instead of possible 6.

Every player is facing the same research track, same difficulty.
So to me they are different.

Not sure if you are after increasing the complexity of the temples, or the difficulty of the temples, but I am assuming difficulty.
If that is the case a simple solution would be for every step that has multiple options, you must pay the option you have chosen and the (or one of) the adjacent costs, in a similar fashion to Bronze temple tiles.

Alternatively if you own Missing Expedition, use the

moving waterfall rapids tiles from campaign mission 5

to add unpredictability.

base game temples are too easy to play with the leaders

Are you running out of temple tiles and just have an excess of research resources? Why is it "easy"?

Indeed, I also don't fully understand the problem. You're competing against other players, after all, not against the research track.

From the Expedition Leaders Rulebook

This means that if your leaders are researching their way toward the Bird Temple or the Snake Temple, you will find the game somewhat easier than normal. You'll have a better chance of moving high up the research track.

I am not an experienced player, but the above quote implies that design is not working as intended with the leaders and the original temples.
I expect that an easier to climb research track would imply a more research dominated game than designed, but that is besides the point.

But you clearly still need to play better than your opponents to win! It's not somehow easier for everyone to win just because you might progress on the research track more easily.

But you clearly still need to play better than your opponents to win! It's not somehow easier for everyone to win just because you might progress on the research track more easily.

Well sure, it is almost a tautology even. You can for example add an extra queen to each side in chess. It would not be easier to win as it is symmetric and you have to best the other player, but it would be a less balanced game with more one dimensional strategies.
It would still utterly destroy the game, though. So that is a pretty vacuous point.

We personally don't like to play with Leaders every time, so what we do is alternate Leaders/No Leaders.  When it's No Leaders turn, we alternate between Bird/Snake.  When it's Leaders turn, we alternate between Lizard/Monkey/Waterfall/Tree.  It's a nice system and keeps the variability high.

...that's a pretty insulting answer.
We played bird temple with leaders (teaching new players the game) and it was totally fine. Yeah, people get up the track faster and more of those final tiles at the top got taken, but it hardly "utterly destroyed the game".

Claiming that "the design is not working as intended" is not true.
The original temples have not been designed with leaders in mind, since they didn't exist at the time, and rather than trying to tweak the leaders to made them a perfect fit, they just created 2 new tracks.
Anyway, as said by others leaders do not break the original tracks.

Was not my intention to insult anyone, or claim that this would utterly destroy the game. I gave an exaggerated answer with a silly example to convey my point. I am not playing optimally so I would not be breaking game anytime soon even with the original tracks.
I apologize to Russ if I was offensive somehow.

I don't understand the argument here. The original temples have not been designed with leaders in mind, thus they will not be working as designed with them. It is cool that if they don't break the original tracks, but if they were totally in balance there would not be any disclaimers in the rulebook.
I really don't understand the defense made by everyone here. Is it somehow perceived as an attack to a beloved game? Most of the replies are trying to prove why my question is wrong, even though everyone agrees that the balance is different. Whether or not it breaks the game, it is a different, less balanced experience. I want the more balanced experience with the base temple tracks, and my question was about that.

Whether or not it breaks the game, it is a different, less balanced experience. I want the more balanced experience with the base temple tracks, and my question was about that.

And that is simply not possible. If you change the base temple tracks, you are no longer playing with the base temple tracks, but with different ones.

This doesn't answer your question, but an alternative way of obtaining the two additional temples that you are seeking would be to buy

, which has two new and arguably even more challenging research tracks.

Yeah but then I will be having 4 temples, instead of possible 6.

I must have misunderstood your question, then. In your original post, you said

After querying this before and not getting a resolution I have created three extra
Simple Leaders
. My issue being, Lost Ruins being a good go to game which I can teach in 10 mins and to mix it up we wish to play with the more complex temples, which are generally suited to the Expedition Leaders as they have more resource available but some are casual players and the added complexity, setup, rules teach and AP wasn’t working. So, after calculation I’ve created three more
Simple Leaders
the
Pirate
, the
Outrider
and the
Ranger
which two require

The Missing Expedition

to play, and one that requires

Expedition Leaders

to play, other than that I think they match up to the official ones
Prospector
and
Traveller
:
Pirate

Fear, Fear, Exploration, Funding, Chronometer, Dinghy, 1 Reserve Tile -2 Fear
Outrider

Fear, Fear, Exploration, Funding, Soda Pop, Motorcycle
And
Ranger

Fear, Fear, Funding, Funding, Bow and Arrows, Parachute
requires Expedition Leaders to play.
[Edit] Mariner becomes Pirate w/-2 Fear Token to balance VP of starter cards.

Hats off if you can teach this game in 10 minutes. There are enough weird things ("it's deck building but...", "it's worker placement but.." etc.) that it has always been 20 or more with new players.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've just noticed on my playthrough yesterday that there are item cards equivalent to almost every tent site (Gold Pan, Automobile/Steamboat, Carrier Pigeon and the Parrot) except there's no counterpart to the tent for arrowheads.
I'm just a little intrigued why that's the case. Would you deem an item giving one arrowhead too powerful?

I don't think it'd be too powerful, it's just not very exciting. I guess it'd probably cost 2 coins and only provide 1 car or boat.

The majority of tier 1 sites give arrow heads don't they?
I know guardians usually require them.
I know there are a few artifacts that give them, I think more than the other resources.

4 of the 10 provide arrowheads.

Looking to play this for the first time tomorrow with my family. After watching the Shelfside review (excellent as always), they reckoned at least three hours for new player
Is this correct??

Depends on the player count. Generally, with 4 players it takes us about three hours. And that's not including the rules teach.
By the way, for a lot games there is a thread with a poll for the play time. No need to start a new thread for this frequently asked question.

Depends on how used to 'modern' games folk are. I played base game with 2 occasional gamers and it was 3 hours including teach - so call it an hour per player.

The time will fly by.  This game is soooooo much fun.  I'm subscribing to this thread, so please let us know how it goes and how everyone liked it.

It always ends up longer than I would expect. But it doesn't always
feel
as long as it actually takes because it's engaging. Expect a long play with new players.
The shortest my wife and I ever achieved (2 player only), using the Bird Temple board (easy), and no expedition leaders, attempting a short play, was 80 minutes.

I have played many times at 4 players, and never came close to 3 hours. Longest was approaching 2 hours, but most games are under 90 minutes.

Yes, apologies- 4 players

Half an hour, one hour at the longest

I've played Arnak for 3 hours even at 2 players. I've also had games that took 100 minutes. Neither was with totally new players, but rather different approach to the game. Arnak has a great min-max comboing potential. Some people are into that, some aren't. The difference in points between the 3-hour games and 100-minute games is huge. Generally I dislike those rushed games more than the ones that take forever, because I always leave the game with regrets I could have accomplished more. The feeling of figuring out a way to play 12 cards in a single round, in a game that's by default designed to only let you play 5, is very satisfying. But I know people who just want to play the game randomly and be done with it, and they still enjoy it. To me both approaches are fine, as long as you're with the right people.

But it doesn't always
feel
as long as it actually takes because it's engaging.

That's the most fitting description of Arnak I've ever heard. I've played stressful, meaningless 30-minute games that felt longer than any 2-hour play of Arnak.

I have played many times at 4 players, and never came close to 3 hours. Longest was approaching 2 hours, but most games are under 90 minutes.

Perfect - thank you!,

Assuming everyone played for at least 2 games previously, then a 2 players game lasts for about an hour and half.
Add extra 30~40 minutes of time every additional player.
If everyone has played for at least like 7~10 times, I would start off at 1 hour (except for setting up and clean up)
then add extra ~25 minutes for additional players.
But really, it really depends how much the players take their time during their turn.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is, is there any way to use this expansion without printing them? Is there perhaps an app version?
Are there any UK options for printing them out as actual tiles, rahter than paper?
Thanks

Yes, there's an app:
https://solo.arnak.game/

Does that use the tiles on the website?

Does that use the tiles on the website?

The web app has the green, red, and purple solo tiles.

I used glue to stick them on the back of some blank chunky cardboard square tiles i bought from Amazon. Works great! You have to be careful pasting the arrows on the backs to make them indistinguishable

How do i set it up? I can't see anything that lets me edit the rival deck

Sorry for taking so long to reply, I've been away for a few days.
The missing page for printing The Shaman has already been uploaded to Google Drive. You can find it in "06.The Shaman > Print Files".
On the other hand, it would be great if you were encouraged to test any of the opponents. If you do, it would be very helpful if you could share with me the score you got and, if you have time, tell me your impressions. You can share it in the

or through private messages. It would be very helpful!
Thanks!

Hi All,
My company and I played about 15 games with 4 players, using expedition leaders, and we made the following observations:
1) Players using the
Baroness
and the
Journalist
usually fall far behind the player who won the game.
- We found that the effectiveness of the
Baroness
depends largely on the items she can buy. If there is no item on offer that would be useful to her in the given round, the Special Delivery card is useless (except of course the plaen icon which can be used for travel). Unfortunately, this effect becomes stronger as the game progresses, as fewer and fewer items are available. The 1 gold received per round was also not found to be particularly strong.
- In the case of the
Journalist
, it is difficult to get the articles for which you are rewarded, as they are cost to travel icons. Of course, assistants with travel icons, or cards with double travel icons (which are expensive to get) can help, but the rewards for articles do not give you significantly more resources than you invested to get them.
2) Players using the
Captain
or the
Mystic
often won or finished in second place
- We found the
Captain
to be easy to use and powerful, which I don't think needs much explanation, it has three archeologist, one of them can be used to activate one of the assistants on the board.
- We found the
Mystic
to be particularly strong, players who played this character often won, and never finished lower than second place. If you have a stable source to exile the fear cards (assistants, cards) you don't need to be afraid of collecting fear cards. Exiled Fear cards can be used to perform powerful rituals, get resources, obtain artifact cards for cheap, even for free, and can even be used to defeat monsters (which can cost a lot of resources in some cases).
The other characters were neither too strong nor too weak in our opinion.
I know that 15 games is not enough to determine the balance, but these are the observations we made based on our games.
What's your opinion?

What's your opinion?

The

rulebook gives information about the first 6 leaders:

Rulebook, page 4

Some leaders are easy to play well.
Others require a bit of experience before you discover how to use their full power.
The list on the right is ordered with the simpler leaders on top and more challenging leaders at the bottom.

The list shows:
Captain
Falconer
Baroness
Professor
Explorer
Mystic
There is no information about difficulty of Journalist and Mechanic in the

rulebook.
There is also no information where they fit in the above mentioned range of 6 leaders.
There are 2 more (easy) leaders mentioned (Prospector and Traveler) for if you don't own the

expansion and you want to play the latest expansion with 3 or 4 players.
I think the leaders are interesting to use, but I mostly play at 2 players (me and my wife), and my wife doesn't like to play with asymmetric player powers.

From personal experience, the Journalist and Mechanic are around the complexity of the Mystic.
I think all are well balanced, but I have really felt the Professor or the Journalist are difficult to get to work for my play style. But I’m sure others will say that’s their go to characters.

Yeah, in our experience my wife nor I rarely lose as the Professor.  And the Baronness and Mystic seem quite weak.

Haha! The Mystic and the Baroness I think are the strongest ones.
Must be a balanced system then!

It's really interesting. Maybe our play style doesn't match with the Baroness. Happy to hear that other players likes here.

I think it's really based on play style preference for how well you can do with them. I've personally gotten my highest scores with the Mystic, since I tend to approach Arnak from the deckbuilding side more than the worker-placement side. Being able to exile cards is pretty much my jam, and that's in Arnak as well as other deckbuilding games. Other leaders that I do well with are Journalist and Falconer.
If you do The Missing Expedition campaign, you also run into situations where one leader is definitely more dominant. Not to give spoilers, but Baronness was pretty nice during one of the missions, play style preference aside. So I think they're all balanced enough, you just have to lean into the leader's strength.

I'd say they are pretty balanced overall. Some are certainly easier to play than others, but if you put the time in you can reach similar results. It also depends quite a bit on the temple track.
I track my high scores for each leader on each temple and the highest average across the 4 expansion temples is only 5 points higher than the lowest average. BTW, highest for me is Baroness, lowest is Captain.

I don't have many multiplayer games played with leaders, though I've played a lot of solo with all the characters.
I feel that Captain, Mystic, and Journalist are most reliant on good synergy cards/assistants to do well.
The Captain wants cards that can take advantage of having a 3rd assistant. Some examples are Theodolite, Ostrich/Sea Turtle, Pathfinder's Staff, etc.
Mystic needs some sites/cards/assistants that add or exile fear, but also, he needs good ways to keep using Boots or discarding cards for benefit. He's much better on the one board that requires paying boots to go up the research track, and the side of the board that has a site that costs 2 boots.
Journalist just needs lots of cheap cards that provide double travel icons, like the gold pan.
If these characters don't get this stuff, they just won't do as well.
The other leaders don't really need anything specific, so I think they're more often going to do better.
My favorite leader is probably Baroness, as it feels fun and interesting having any one of the tools available to use that round if I want. All other leaders stop caring about the Tools for sale pretty quickly, but she cares what's for sale the entire game. She felt extremely good with the 3 coin assistant, but they nerfed that guy a bit. It's still a strong combo though.
My least favorite is probably  the Falconer. The best way to play her seems to be to explore a lvl 2 site on round 2 and then charge up the Falcon power to the max and keep reactivating the lvl 2 site throughout the game for maximum value. This feels very straightforward. Note that I'm not saying she's weak, I'm just saying I don't find her gameplay as fun.

Same here, always lose with the Baroness ... My ranking would be:
Tier 1
Falconer
Mechanic
Professor (difficult to play, but when he works, he is great!)
Tier 2
Captain
Explorer
Mystic
Tier 3
Journalist
Baroness

I agree about the baroness, she is a lot of fun. I love the ability that gives me the purchased card now.
She along with the professor and the mystic (although I probably liked playing with him the least of the 3) really shift the way you can and probably should play the game. Your whole focus and valuation of cards and rewards shifts, you almost get to play a different game with the same rules (or maybe the same game with different rules), it is so much fun. The leaders expansion is one of my favorite expansions I own (for any game), i just love what it added, and the 2 extra leaders in the 2nd expansion are also great.

Hello I'm quite late but here my asnwer
I see win with over 100 VP with all leaders (in playtest ) so, yeha, I assure you they are balanced, the hardest one for me is the explorer, odd to say, and the journalist, I'm in love with falconer, but lately I do good points with the mechanics, that is very versatile,  all leaders are very asym. you know that you can find here

an official playlist with tips?
In 4 players should be a lot of sites where to dig on the main board, and sometimes with baroness is more the ability to draw more cards than others things...

it probably helps to know the player count as well. my tier list (see post above) is only based on 2 players.

Same here, always lose with the Baroness ... My ranking would be:
Tier 1
Falconer
Mechanic
Professor (difficult to play, but when he works, he is great!)
Tier 2
Captain
Explorer
Mystic
Tier 3
Journalist
Baroness

Funny, I always win with the Baroness.  I feel like she is strong in general and extremely strong if some of the tool cards are really desirable.
I have yet to see the Mystic perform well, though he's definitely the most complex.

I found the journalist particularly difficult to use, it needs a lot of travel icons, or money to replace them, to work well.

Just yesterday again, I destroyed my regular opponent (journalist) with the mechanic.

FWIW, after my first three solo plays using leaders (on difficulty 7):
- Using the Falconer I easily beat 100vp the first time (final score 107:79). Falconer encourages you to dig at new sites every round, choosing the right guardian and then defeat it by sending the eagle to the best-matching site.
- The Captain was slightly stronger than playing without a leader, but not by much (final score: 86:77). An extra worker seems great, but to fully utilize it, you also need an extra card each turn to move it where you want. Also, it can be blocked from sites. Abilities/cards that allow you to visit sites without using a worker (like the Falconer) are stronger and more flexible.
- I struggled a bit with the Baroness since her focus is on getting gold to purchase items (final score 75:72). While it's nice to be able to use one of them right away each round, I was lacking the compass tokens to dig as often as I would have liked. It could be that I just didn't see any really good items. I mostly bought some to grant me extra card draws and thinning my deck.

The captain has another ability: he can use the third worker to activate an assistant. For this action he doesn't need any cards or travel icons at all.

Yes. But I felt it's meant as a last resort, in case you aren't able to visit any site. Assistant effects are weaker than visiting any of the sites.

It’s somewhat equivalent to a base site as it doesn’t cost you a travel icon.
But yeah, generally you want to visit a level 1 or level 2 site with it.

Another solo play at difficulty 7; this time with the Professor (final score: 93:87):
In a way the counter-part to the Baroness, but this leader actually works as advertised and makes an alternative strategy focused on acquiring artifact cards viable. I had some incredibly strong turns, playing up to 15 cards in a round, and arguably the most fun since I started playing the game!
I ended up with a lot of Fear cards, though, despite discarding about 5 of them, and started the last round with 3 of them in my hand; otherwise my final score might have been much higher.
My initial guess why the Professor works so well while the Baroness struggles: there's no limit to the number of artifact cards you can play in a given round. The Baroness, though, can play at most one of the newly acquired item cards in a round, and her Special Delivery takes up a card slot to boot.
I wonder if she shouldn't have a permanent ability to have all acquired item cards go directly to her hand... It _might_ be too powerful, though, if it isn't limited in any way.
But I know about the pitfalls of making judgements about balance after a single play, so at this point it's just a hunch based on preliminary anecdotal evidence.

You need to pay one tablet for each artifact played unless you just aquired it.

Yes, but you get some for free, and obviously should prioritize getting them from other sources, too. When I finished the game, I even had two tablets left (yup, bad planning).

The Professor gets 2 free compasses and 2 free tablets, so 4 things. He can potentially get 1 more compass, so up to 5 things.
The Baroness gets 4 free coins over the game. While coins/compasses/tablets are all technically valued the same, compasses and tablets are typically more useful.
With that said, I think Baroness is just fine as is and can do just as well as the other leaders. Many tools in the game provide a lot of value, and being able to play it immediately just translates into more value over a game. Baroness' special card will produce more value than the Professor's ability to reserve 3 artifacts (and buy them at just the right moment).
I think one problem players may run into with Baroness is in general, getting a bunch of tools is bad because the more you get the less you'll draw and play each one, and this is worse for Baroness since she only draws 4 cards per turn. So she actually only wants to buy a few strong tools and the rest should be the kind that exiles after being played.

The Professor gets 2 free compasses and 2 free tablets, so 4 things. He can potentially get 1 more compass, so up to 5 things.

Like the Baroness, he gets more for having artifact cards in play. In my last 3 turns I gained an additional compass and tablet that way. Theoretically, it should be easier for the Baroness to meet the max requirements for the card since playing item cards doesn't require resources.

True. I mainly used the Professor's ability to deny my opponent artifact cards granting 2-3vp by swapping them from the market to my personal reserve.

So she actually only wants to buy a few strong tools and the rest should be the kind that exiles after being played.

I guess that makes sense. Being effectively restricted to 4 cards means you cannot focus completely on acquiring item cards. Ideally, you get one or two great item cards early and then reap the benefits for the rest of the game.

I’m curious if anyone has tried a variant where the dig sites are faced up instead of face down and having a market where a number of them are open to see depending on player count?
I wonder if this will reduce luck of drawing dig sites and rewards, increase competition to get specific sites and allow for more combos and planning.

If you try it please report back.
Personally I like the theme enough to keep them face down - you dig without knowing what you'll find. Sure, you might not find the optimum resources for your situation right now - the challenge is deciding what to do with whatever you found.

That's an interesting idea. I think I agree with Mark about the theme, but I too would like to hear/see how a game with this house rule was implimented.

Balance-wise it seems like it makes digging new sites somewhat more powerful (maybe considerably more powerful? I'm not certain) in a way that might make the 'correct' strategy a little narrower (not sure, but that's what I'd worry about).
Another possibility that doesn't make it quite so deterministic would be "draw 2, pick 1".

I do agree. I love the game and having the sense of exploration definitely adds to the theme but sometimes you feel like your exploration did not pay off, especially because you have to beat the guardian as well so the risk/reward sometimes feels more like risk than reward. Idols being face up sort of helps a bit so at least there’s something deterministic you get but sometimes it doesn’t feel like enough.
I’ll try it in my next plays and report back. I also like the idea of drawing two and keeping one but I think it’s less exciting.
I’m curious if a variant like this was play tested and was what the outcome.
My worry is that it could make the game too open/easy by achieving the top of the temple track + temple tiles much easier.

Do you plan to still award an idol to the player who first visits a dig site that is revealed during setup? Knowing both the dig reward and the idol reward in advance might be a bit too strong. As it is, one or the other is known, but never both. Even getting a face down idol at a known dig site would be stronger than the RAW.
Also, will you send a guardian to such a site?

Two guardians would seem more appropriate... (both must be defeated, but you can only keep one after the completion...)

While I like the attitude, that seems a little overly punitive.
Plus you would need some rules accommodations: what if only one is defeated? Or must both be defeated in one action? If you defeat neither, do you take two fear cards? And with 12 sites and only 15 guardian tiles, you could easily run out, then what?

Getting to see what’s there in advance without having explore blindly is a huge advantage, it should have a similarly high cost

I tried something similar, with the top tile of the sites and guardians being face-up so planning was actually possible. And players would rush/compete to explore more when it's favourable.
Thematically, not knowing what's there when you're exploring is more immersive though.

Mathematically nonsensical.

+1. I'm not a fan of the random site drawing, but I also wouldn't like them to be visible. "draw 2, pick 1" seems like the best of both worlds.
Alternatively, I could imagine something like a free action to 'scout ahead', e.g. by having to spend extra movement icons: draw x site cards and put them back in an order of your choice.

Hi all,
I've added Lost Ruins of Arnak to my randomizer app
Tabletop Setup Wizard
If you cannot decide which Temple, Leader, or Board side to play next time, this app allows you to randomize it.

Nice, what tech stack are you using to write and host this?

Nice, what tech stack are you using to write and host this?

Thanks, I'm using Strapi for DB and API, React on front. DigitalOcean droplet with cleavr.io is used to configure and deploy it.

Fresh from
WSBG
in Vegas, Mín & Elwen are heading to SPIEL! They’ll be available on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 4–5 PM CEST at the CGE booth (3Z411)
, along with a sneak peek of upcoming (and not-yet-named) expansion content for Lost Ruins of Arnak.
So if you're attending and want to meet them—or get a glimpse of what’s coming next in Arnak—be sure to stop by!
In addition to Mín & Elwen, you’ll also have the chance to meet Tomáš Holek (

) and Matúš Kotry (

,

,

). And on Thursday, they’ll be joined by Ondřej Bystroň (

).

I certainly will pop by to meet Mín & Elwen!
And done!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi everyone! Mín and I are currently at WSBG, and it’s been wonderful seeing so many people playing Arnak here. We brought a prototype of some new content with us, and it’s been a blast testing it with some of the best Arnak players in the world!
Since the first images are already making their way into the media, we wanted to share some details so you have the right expectations.
First and foremost, everything you see is still in prototype form. We don’t have a release date yet, and anything can change. The full official announcement will come sometime in 2025.
At its core, we’re working on a storage solution with a much sturdier box for all Arnak content (and yes, we’ll make sure it fits sleeved cards too!). But we thought it would be a bit sad to ship just an empty box, so we designed a brand-new, double-sided map! (No new leaders or cards this time, sorry!)
Right now, we’re showcasing one side of the map, which already has its illustration underway, but both maps are currently in testing—each bringing a unique mechanism to the game.
Just to be clear, this is not a new edition or a spin-off. The box won’t include the base game or any of the previously released expansions.
After WSBG, we’re heading straight to Essen Spiel, and we’ll be bringing the box with us. If you’re curious to see it in more detail, come say hi to us at the CGE booth!

Awesome news! Looking forward to hearing more about it!

This is wonderful! I’m so excited to see what the final product will end up looking like next year.

Looking forward to it.  I hope the card and token holders are a little more thematic and look like wooden crates and stone temples.

Wow what a coincedence. Guess what game is now set up on my table, as I am just learning to play...

Storage systems always helpful! Couple new maps too has me intrigued.

This is welcome news. I look forward to learning more. Thank you!

Will the new map be sold separately? I'm not at all interested in buying a bigger box but I would certainly consider getting a new map.

Wow! Great news!

Will there be an option of a Big Box version which includes all released content so far?

Thanks everyone!
The storage solution box will come with the insert and the new maps. The base game and the two previously released expansions will continue to be available separately, so if you’re interested in any of those, there’s no need to wait for the new box.
As for the rest of the info, we’ll just have to wait for the official announcement in 2025!

I typically don't like big boxes, but this one looks very manageable and if it comes with a functional insert, I'm for it! Plus the new board looks like great fun!

I hope the inserts can be directly put into the corresponding places in the map for a quick set up and tear down.

This is key for me – the main thing that stops me from playing Arnak more often is that it takes a long time to set up, if the storage solution can speed that up, I'm all in.

Here!

Thanks for giving us a great game! I have it like thousands of other players around the world and I've got the two expansions of course. Looking forward to being able to order the box and the new board (also on the French market hopefully???)

I'm thankful to read this and hope that in part the notion to develop a larger box was as a result of this thread...
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3309056/article/44909896#44...
...as I like to thing that designers listen to and action player suggestions from time to time
Regardless once it's available it will be an instant purchase in our house.

Thanks for the great game! Since I’ve already bought a rather expensive storage solution for your game, I’m really hoping this new map will be available without having to buy the storage box. Otherwise I will have to skip this expansion, which would be very sad.

I'm in the same boat.  The box looks way too big as well since I can fit everything in the base game box.

The current box fits base game + 1,5 expansions sleeved, so the new box should not be much bigger...

I really hope so... Please try to keep the box as small as possible, those giant tall boxes are terrible

Sweet!
However, the new game board looks so huge. It’s like two original game board putting together. Not sure if my table could handle that.

The latest Dice Tower vlog includes 2 very short clips of the LRoA Big Box!  I believe it was just revealed at WSBG and not a ton of details yet, but more Arnak coming for us. Hooray
Relevant clips below. Enjoy!
DT Vlog - Clip 1
DT Vlog - Clip 2

That looks so cool!  Anything Arnak is an insta-buy for me.  That being said, I'm happier that it appears to be a storage box with a new map and not a true "big box".

I am torn.
I will happily buy anything Arnak. BUT
Anything "Big box" is a big NO-NO from me.

Gollum, gollum.

Yeah a big box

As long as they don't force people who just want to buy the new map (and tokens) to buy the big box, I'm okay.

Insta buy, bring it

The components for the cards seems really tight. Will sleeved cards fit?

Wow, it seems that there are not only big boxes, but also new maps and temples. Will there be a new expansion?

"We've had one box. but what about an insert?"
"I don't think he knows about an insert, Pip."

to be fair, I don't think anybody is forcing you to buy anything

Ah, I forgot to caveat my statement. Yes, nobody is forcing anyone to do anything; but when you want to have everything, it's nice if you don't need to shell out for the entire big box.

Just one? I'd kinda expect it to be double-sided.
[edit]
And are those black tablets in spots under the base camp locations?

I've managed to fit everything (two expansions plus the base game and sleeved cards) in the base game box. I'm hoping the new map fits in the base box and maybe I just need to put some stuff in one of the expansion boxes.

Me too, but it's all far too heavy for the very flimsy base game box I find. I hope the new box is made of stronger stuff!

I don't trust the base game box with everything (plus, I'd have to redo my foamcore insert!). Looking forward to more info

I have everything in the base box with (heavy) plastic inserts and also metal coins and working compasses, and the box carries the weight without any problem.

FYI direct from the designers -
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3374973/greetings-from-min-...

Man this is a tough one for me. I like Arnak a lot but it doesn’t really hit the table since I bought the most recent expansion, just too much work to set up and sort. Even with having almost everything in the base box (which I prefer with most games) this is the case, and the box is really packed and heavy. A Big Box could help but also legit Big Boxes have been aptly labeled as board game coffins so I’m always leery about buying them. Plus part of the issue wouldn’t be solved with a larger box, there are just so many components now.

Yep, this needs an insert to relieve setup and tear down times. Hopefully that's part of the box.

And I'm glad. It rockets up the research track. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Don't really care, I like a challenge.
Anyway, I was wondering about a variant for those tiles that just block resources.
What if: you draw one, resolve it, then remove it to a second discard area (D2).
When you go to resolve it and find the board space already blocked, take the bottom tile from the discard pile and resolve that, then remove it to D2 as well.
The point? So that something is always happening. A real player knowing he can't move to an ioccupied area will do something else. Now maybe he would have to pass, but in solo you are up against an AI that's an amalgam of all other players so it gets more actions and more meeples.
At the end of the round, you shuffle all tiles, wherever they get discarded, as normal.
I have no idea if this is a bad idea. But I hate snakes Jack, I hate 'em!

by tiles you mean the AI tiles?
it's really only in the first (maybe second) round that sometimes he won't have anywhere to go, I think it works fine.

... in solo you are up against an AI that's an amalgam of all other players so it gets more actions and more meeples.

Not really.
The AI always takes 10 turns in a round, simulating 3 other players and at random denying the human player to go where they want.
Although, if you know what is in the AI action stack, and keep track of the tiles played, you can benefit from "knowing" what the AI's action will be in their next turn.
Later in the game it is possible that the human player has more main actions in a round than the AI, but you need to play good.

Not doing anything wrong if you get left behind on the research track - the AI moves way faster than players can plausibly do so, at least in the early game. As long as you reach the top by the end you'll still score plenty of points.

I'm confused by the text. I need ten tiles, but If i slect zero red tiles then I add zero green tiles because they have to be paired?
I watched Paul Grogan's video and he seemed to offer a completely different explanation: you pick zero to all of the red tiles and then make up the difference with the greens.
What is the correct procedure Indy?

Paul Grogan will have had the correct procedure.
The red and green tiles are paired but in the sense that each red tile is a slightly more challenging version of one of the green tiles.  You should always have exactly one of each pair included, so that you have the five effects always represented but optionally either an easier or harder version.  At the extreme ends, you could have all five green and no red for the easiest setting, or all five red and no green for the hardest setting.  But you can mix and match, in which case you'd e.g. start from all green, then remove some number of those green tiles and replace them with their paired red tiles.

Many thanks. I don't think the rulebook explained this part satisfactorily personally.
Deckbuilders are weird like that I think

The rules are very clear on how to create the Rival deck...
Use all five archaeologist tiles.
Use five red or green tiles.
The description about pairs just says that you must use one of each pair so that all five actions are in the stack.  More red makes the Rival stronger.
Be careful about thinking the game is a deck builder.   It isn't.   It's a game that has a deck building element, so if you think you are just going to work on improving your deck, you won't do very well.

Many thanks. I don't think the rulebook explained this part satisfactorily personally.

As Stephen Cooper already said: The (English) rules are very clear.
I've highlighted 2 important parts of the rules text.

Rulebook, page 20

Build your rival’s action stack with 10 action tiles.
Use all 5 archaeologist action tiles
Use 5 red or green action tiles
The action tiles come in pairs. The red action is a more aggressive version of the green action.
All 5 actions need to be in the stack, so you need one tile from each pair.

I get that. I'm quite happy with it. I have the Leaders expasion as well, to add in later on
EDIT, I need to clarify: you can only move an archaeologist from your camp. Not from somewhere else on the board, correct?

I need to clarify: you can only move an archaeologist from your camp. Not from somewhere else on the board, correct?

Yes, correct.
However, there are some cards that let you move your archaeologist from one site to another. In English that's called "relocate", see rulebook, page 24.

Thanks for clarifying

I was playing Arnak with my friends and tried to use an Idol tile to exile an item card. On the item card, it said « Exile this card to buy an artifact with a discount of 4 compass ». Do I still get the effect of the card or do I simply exile the card without having the benefits? My friends argued that since I did not actively used an Exile action to exile the card, I could not use the effect of the item. Thoughts?

Unfortunately, your friends are correct. You have to play the card from your hand as your action to get the effect of the item.

I don’t understand your question. You are getting the effect of the card you played, which is to exile the card to buy and artifact card for much cheaper.
What card are you trying to “get the effect of”? Can you list the exact cards involved?

I don’t understand your question. You are getting the effect of the card you played, which is to exile the card to buy and artifact card for much cheaper.

No, they didn't play the card. They were using an idol with an "exile a card" effect to exile the item card. This would just exile the card with no effect.

1) Unless you play the card the effect «Exile this card to buy an artifact with a discount of 4 compass» is not going into effect :-)
2) You use the idol therefor the effect is not triggered.
3) Finally: It is a bad idea to exile this card without using the effect. You don't want to do that!  Exile a curse card or choose another idol with a better effect.

Leila is correct.
To gain the effect of the card you must use your main action to play the card.  Upon playing the card you exile it and gain an artifact up to the discounted cost.
In your example you've used the main action discover a site (gaining the idol), so you cannot also play the card.

Ah, I missed that they were using the idol effect to exile the card. My reading comprehension failed me

Perhaps you wise people can also clarify this one:
If one is to play
Little Monkey
which reads
"You may exile one item from the card row and refill it"
.
Would you then be allowed to exile
Airdrop
(Exile this card to gain an item for free to your hand)
from the card row and thus take a remaining item for free?

No.
You're exiling a card with little monkey, not activating the power of the card you're exiling.
Airdrop says "Exile this card to gain an item for free to your hand" which is its power when activated, not exiled.
Otherwise, card would have said something like "If this is card is exiled, gain an item for free to your hand"

Makes sense! Thanks a lot for the quick clarification!

Hello I accidentally bought the game in German on Amazon, if I found the rules without problems translated, would anyone have a link for the translation of the cards in French or English? Thanks

You can try and find them in a TTS mod also there are some tier lists of the cards where you can take a look at them
https://tiermaker.com/create/lost-ruins-of-arnak-artifacts-1...
https://tiermaker.com/create/lost-ruins-of-arnak-items-15076...
I hope it is useful

Arnak is available on tabletop simulator. You have to purchase it in steam if you don't have it already. The game itself is free.
Checking the cards you need and learning them by heart is one way, the other way is to extract the cards and print, this requires some basic skills.

I'd just sell it and buy it again. Probably I'll lose some money in the process, but a lot less headache.

In this situation I would take the loss - sell it off and buy an English copy, having to reference across would be a nightmare.

This! And try foam core! I have played Arnak 50 physical times because I made an insert, else there are too many thing too open..
I played at a boardgames cafe and it was a pain

If you don't mind paying a bit extra, you can order a set of cards in English direct from CGE. That's what I did, and their customer service was excellent. I got a full set of English cards for the base and two expansions for 20 EUR, including shipping (to Japan).

My gaming group is mainly TTRPG and coop oriented, so getting this to the table as anything other than solo is just not really an option for me.
I had an idea for some alternative cooperative goals for 2-4 players using essentially the base rules (haven't done anything with expansions yet).
At all difficulties, at least one player must reach the top of the temple track with their magnifying glass.  On top of that, they have to beat a number of guardians per player and reach a target average/total score.  Introductory would be 1 guardian and 30 points per player, easy would be 2 guardians and 40 points per player, normal would be 3 guardians and 50 points per player, hard requires 4 guardians and 60 points per player.
I'm also considering a fail state involving the fear cards (deck runs out= game over) in place of the point goals.
I might do some play testing and check out the expansions (I have them, I just haven't done anything with them yet).  Any thoughts or suggestions?

The Missing Expedition expansion has a 1-2 player cooperative campaign.  Might be a start to what you're looking for.

4 Guardians and 60 points should pretty much be the goal in any competitive game (at least on the Bird temple).
I would expect some higher goals in coop mode. 4 Guardians & 80 points maybe?
If you got the expansions check the second one - it got a coop campaign. Maybe you could get some more hints or guidelines from that as well.
PS: this thread is probably better placed in the Variants section...

Guardians per player isn't appropriate for determining difficulty for 3 and 4 player games. There are only 12 sites, which makes Hard literally impossible in 4 players and requires perfection in a 3-player game. You'll need to scale that based on player count as well instead of just difficulty.
Target average score is too low: 1 guardian and 30 points is a total of 35 points. It's already incredibly difficult to score fewer than 50. I appreciate that you wanted a consistent +15 across levels, but I think a more reasonable revision would be 50-60-70-80-90. Intro Easy Normal Hard Insane. Might be fun to make it a minimum score every player has to beat instead of it being an average score.
Ideas for co-op
Minimum score per player
Minimum research track progress per player
X sites explored in total
X guardians defeated in total
X temple tiles acquired in total
These are the simpler parameters to play around with. There's still a lot of design space remaining but the rules would be far clunkier if we were to go beyond these.

Was wondering if someone could help me out:
1. The newspapers on your player board have a combination of main and free actions you can activate by publishing your articles. Lets say I use a main action to discover a new location and use a free action (by paying the travel cost) in the same turn to publish the article that can be found on that location. I immediately use the article to cover up a slot that has no free action symbol to buy an artifact that I want with reduced cost as stated on the newspaper. Am I able to do this, because I already used up my main action to discover a new location?
2. Is publishing an article through the Investigation card a free action or does the free action symbol only apply to the compass you get by playing the card?
Thanks in advance for helping out!

No, you can't.
You can write the article as a free action when you discover a new site as your main action.
The article token is placed on your player board, somewhere between your draw pile and the assistant spaces.
To publish the written article, you can immediately use a space with a flash symbol (free action)
or you can use a non-free action space as a main action in your next turn
.
So you can't use the written article in the way you have described, and you can't buy the artifact in the same turn.

2. Is publishing an article through the Investigation card a free action or does the free action symbol only apply to the compass you get by playing the card?

The Investigation card says:
[flash] [compass]
And
you may pay [plane] to write a feature article.
The "And" indicates that writing a feature article is part of gaining a compass as a free action.
To write the feature article, play a card with a plane travel symbol (or pay 2 coins), take one article from above your player board, and place it somewhere between your draw deck and the assistant spaces on your player board.
That ends this free action.
Then as above, you can publish the written feature article:
- on a [flash] space as a new free action.
- on a space without a flash symbol as a main action, which you only can do this turn if you haven't played a main action yet.

I recently played

Distilled

, and what shocked me was how unapplicable the theme was to the gameplay. Immediately when it was pitched, I clarified, "So, we all had the same relative with multiple equivalent distilleries, or all our relatives died at once? Was this an inside job?" With no answer, I charged on anyway only end up with more questions. You mean to tell me that from all these ingredients I mixed to make alcohol, some can vanish and completely change the recipe from what I sought to make? Moreover, the even bigger impact to what comes out of the distillation process is the sheets of paper a few feet away? That even though I know all these recipes staring at me from the start, only the ones I've purchased can be the magical outcome of this equation? That's to say nothing of the fact that most of the game is spent in a simple open draft for ingredients, a process with no real world parallel. I've already

discussed

how the best variable market drafting game is

Star Realms

, and the theme is likewise light there. However, my main point is that "thematic" games are ill-defined at best, a source of unspoken disagreement at worst. Likewise, I've seen many complaints that Lost Ruins of Arnak is not thematic, and I don't understand any of them.
In a move I've seldom if ever seen, there are actual reasons in this worker placement game for why workers cannot occupy the same space, why they can only do one thing each, and why the turn order matters. It would be rude to interfere when another archeologist called dibs on a site which keeps them busy all day, and the preparations to send out personnel take time with even the slightest hesitance making all the difference. The unknown nature of exploration is perfectly represented by uncovering variable sites. Compare this to

Archipelago

where a single-use signal flare tells all your hermaphroditic (potentially incestuous) workers to breed on command, just so long as no else from your company is third-wheeling; other spectators are fine. Compare this to

Caverna

/

Agricola

where building a room summons a cryptid that causes knowledge of that process to disappear from all nearby villages for a time. Compare this to

Everdell

where you control the pace of the seasons, just not for anyone else. In

I C E

, my archaeologist can dig on someone else's behalf against my will! I suppose that for Arnak, I should clarify people generally level this criticism at the research track, but what is it about navigating and mapping cavernous ruins by the guidance of messages in a forgotten language through one's findings that isn't thematic? These discoveries serve as the pinnacle of learning about the eponymous ruins, and the first player to reach certain rooms can find caches of supplies and treasures. All the mechanics have lore implications. Even dismantling idols for research with diminishing returns on investment makes sense.
Concerning the implementation of these themes, the writings I've seen about the game share that it was designed mechanically first with a theme decided later, and this should be irrelevant for determining whether that theme comes through in gameplay. That said, what solid mechanics they picked! The mathematical balance of cards in this game is astounding, and it breaks down what would otherwise be complex calculations with a few clever icons and multipurpose cards. Compare this to

Dune: Imperium

, a similar game generally agreed to have an iffy balance in its base game and which also primarily has points coming from moving up (less interesting) tracks. In addition to that, discovering new sites and navigating different research tracks always keeps the game fresh. In terms of specific mechanics, deckbuilding is always weak thematically, but it works fine enough as a delayed purchase mechanism with uncertain timing with no less thematic ties here than in any other game. On the flip side, my biggest complaint about worker placement as a mechanic is the general lack of replayability. For example, I stumbled across a winning strategy on my first play of

Raiders of the North Sea

and have been doing that every time since; the only time it failed me, I didn't account for the effect of player count on game length, meaning that across 6 or so plays, I have learned exactly one new thing. Meanwhile, I've employed many different strategies every play of Arnak, having never lost any of them, and even then my scores pale in comparison to the best I've seen on BGG. I almost never get both assistants, let alone both to their gold side. That distant ceiling knowing just how much potential this game has gives me hope for a game that never ceases to be interesting.
In light of this, is this how we are to regard theme? A couple of ideas shared in the design process that don't hold up to scrutiny, or as something that serves to explain all the mechanics? Aren't simulations the best in terms of theme, and isn't Arnak an excellent simulation of braving uncharted ruins, seeking help, overcoming adversity, quenching fears, and returning with dazzling prizes? I am glad to have purchased this game, and its ever-changing puzzle is one I will always enjoy solving.

Fun read, and well written.  Thanks for sharing!
I find it curious that people compare this game to Dune Imperium.  I understand they share some mechanics, but they are no more alike than are Lisboa and Everdell, which both feature card play combined with worker placement.  I bought Lost Ruins of Arnak because so many people compared it to Dune Imperium, which is on my top 10 list, but LRoA fell flat for me.  It just felt like a generic resource management game to me.
I agree with the OP that the mechanics were probably developed first and a theme pasted on later, but that's likely the case with a lot of euros.  I think if a player enjoys a game they can overlook the theme/gameplay disconnect, but if they don't enjoy it then they start to nitpick the poor theme integration.  I saw someone on Reddit say that defeating guardians may as well be workers out collecting wood because, mechanically, the theme just doesn't pop, and I agree, but maybe that's just because I don't enjoy the game.
So, my point is, how much the theme does or doesn't bother a player probably has more to do with how much a player enjoys the game and less to do with the actual theme integration itself.

In spirit making you do actually remove the top and tail and reuse it. That's a real thing in the process.
Anyway...there's no right or wrong on theme it's all opinion and what one person perceives as well themed may be very different from another. It comes down to how the theme is communicated via art and mechanics, how that communication is received varies by person, ie its down to how much the elements "speak" to a person. Various things affect this including taste and where one puts the dividing line between real life and abstraction.
At the end of the day all games are abstract. There's a whole spectrum of how theme is integrated into that abstraction. Personally I always find this whole debate repetitive. This is such a part of board game reviews now, as if a good game depends on theme integration. I don't know why people obsess over it. Theme is great and I enjoy themes in games as if helps me connect to the mechanics more easily and I love game art. That does help me enjoy the experience more, but it's separate to the actual game for me.
That said I sometimes think that when people say a game is really thematic, I think it might be in part because when they play the game they find themselves thinking about the mechanics in thematic terms without much effort. For example in Distilled, many players find they can focus on the theme instead of the mechanics. For example, instead of thinking about adding more cards to increase the chance of success, you are thinking about what ingredients you can add to your distiller. You can easily stop thinking about cards and only think about the items, the spirits. Yes it's imagination, but the mechanics kind of fall away.
Whereas in Arnak, whilst agree I think the theme is really nicely done in the game, I'm thinking more about the mechanics while playing. Collecting resources that I'll spend on a track, spending resources to collect the guardian tile. Spending the bonuses on my player board to get extra actions. I think that's why people often say Arnak is not very thematic, they are talking about how it feels to play, not whats going on in the game design.
Roccoco is another one where many mechanics in it almost dissappear because its very easy to think, "ok i need my apprentice to go and buy some silk, and then one of my master dress makers can make the blue dress and then I'll lend it out to someone for them to wear in the prestigious kings hall and if I sponsor some of the fireworks I'll be able to get them a spot on the roof where they'll be spotted with my dress on." You start thinking about strategy in thematic terms.

This is paraphrased this from another explanation... somewhere... but it sounds to me like you're confusing
theme
with
realism.
A highly thematic game is simply well-integrated, through visuals and vocabulary, to it's subject. For Arnak it's exploration and research on a lost island - quasi-Indiana Jones stuff. It's true, at it's heart it's pretty basic euro resource management mechanics, but everything is designed to evoke that setting. In video game terms, it's like a skin. Whether or not that theme speaks to you is really the most important thing.
Realism, on the other hand, is where the game mechanic goes out of its way to try and reflect an actual process. Distilled may come a little closer to this, in terms of having steps involving different types of stills, sourcing ingredients, and aging your spirits. And like Rich said, removing the top and tail are part of the actual process. Those are all factors of real-life distillation. But even then, it's still a game, and there's plenty of game-y mechanics in place to force players to take risks and try different things. Generally speaking, realism is much harder to find, because, well... they're games.
And as Rich said, if someone likes a theme, they can focus on it instead of the mechanics. I think it's noteworthy that you really like Arnak's theme and feel "all the mechanics have lore implications." The more someone enjoys a theme, the more they can see connections to the theme through mechanics. The beautiful part is they're not wrong - they're just playing the game with a different lens, which make it more enjoyable.

Arnak is far more thematic than many “Thematic” games I’ve played. I think a lot of gamers who are super into “thematic games” just like the kinds of games associated with those genres, more than I think they like anything particularly “thematic.” Of course not all euros are thematic. But among those that are, I’ve never felt they somehow had “less” theme than games that are more in the thematic popular genres. I think especially CGE games are great at being thematic while not ever falling into the pitfalls of just being another thematic genre game (I feel like a lot of supposedly very thematic games all end up feeling like same-same dice chuckers, which I’m sure feels thematic to folks who like those things, but seldom does to me)

Easy way to make Arnak a bit more thematic (at least for me) would have been to give the site tiles and guardian tiles some sort of name and maybe even a short description too. Just like they did (without the description) with the item cards. Such treatment would have easily made them more memorable and thematic, probably helping to "set the tone" to the theme too. I have played a lot of Terraforming Mars and the small description in the project cards in that game helps the theme to pop a lot (at least in my mind)!

I wanted to address all your comments thoroughly, hence taking a bit to respond... and racking up a comparable word count in the process. Thank you all for sharing!

Fun read, and well written.  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you as well for reading and offering feedback.

I find it curious that people compare this game to Dune Imperium.  I understand they share some mechanics

For me, this is explanation enough. I am not drawing comparison to say one is derivative but rather to highlight how, after accounting for similarities, why those differences lead to such different opinions. This is what I seek to explore, and that curiosity led to me titling this review as I did.

I agree with the OP that the mechanics were probably developed first and a theme pasted on later, but that's likely the case with a lot of euros.

I thought I saw this in an article somewhere confirming it to be the case for Arnak, but now I can't find it.

So, my point is, how much the theme does or doesn't bother a player probably has more to do with how much a player enjoys the game and less to do with the actual theme integration itself.

I disagree with this point on the grounds that theme plays its own factor in enjoyment, not as a confounding variable.

Fast & Fhtagn

has one of the best themes ever, yet the gameplay is bad. By comparison, no one is decrying

Chess

for flying horses (not that I've checked).

...defeating guardians may as well be workers out collecting wood because, mechanically, the theme just doesn't pop, and I agree, but maybe that's just because I don't enjoy the game.

This is another case that I feel I can defend. Guardians can be subdued through force with the appropriate tools (e.g. Revolver, War Club), but there are also things they seek to preserve of their homeland that will placate them. It takes time to figure this out and to make the offering or to plan a attack as represented by the additional action cost. Once befriended (or scared into submission), they will offer a favor for you, but being forced to retreat while under threat causes trauma in the form of fear cards. Collecting wood does not fit those mechanics neatly if at all.
In essence, what I'm saying is that there can be justifications for these choices, and that is why I defend Arnak as thematic.
Also worth noting that the rulebook flavor text, which I should have checked first, confirmed everything I already wrote above.

In spirit making you do actually remove the top and tail and reuse it. That's a real thing in the process.

Correct. My point is that I do not believe the mechanics represent that well.

Various things affect this including taste and where one puts the dividing line between real life and abstraction.

Likewise correct. My understanding of theme is one I am seeking to compare to that of others, and I am doing that with a breakdown of those game mechanics I have heard described as unthematic with parallels to those mechanics in other games which do not receive such criticism.

At the end of the day all games are abstract. There's a whole spectrum of how theme is integrated into that abstraction. Personally I always find this whole debate repetitive. This is such a part of board game reviews now, as if a good game depends on theme integration. I don't know people obsess over it. There is great and I enjoy themes in games as if helps me connect to the mechanics more easily and I love game art. That does help me enjoy the experience more, but it's separate to the actual game for me.

Very well put. To be honest, theme isn't even that important to me, but I think it's cool when done right. That is why I want to defend Arnak for what I think is a well-integrated theme.

That said I sometimes think that when people say a game is really thematic, I think it might be in part because when they play the game they find themselves thinking about the mechanics in thematic terms without much effort.

I agree with this point—players should not have to dig for theme—but I disagree with your examples.

For example, instead of thinking about adding more cards to increase the chance of success, you are thinking about what ingredients you can add to your distiller. You can easily stop thinking about cards and only think about the items, the spirits. Yes it's imagination, but the mechanics kind of fall away.

I was always considering the two-card removal and how a guarantee meant including two extra of the sugar I needed, else my alcohol would change type entirely based on unlocked recipes. That coupled with the open draft personally took me out of the experience.

Whereas in Arnak, whilst agree I think the theme is really nicely done in the game, I'm thinking more about the mechanics while playing.

This is subjective, but I think that may come down to the granularity in Arnak. There are many more choices and uses for resources in Arnak, hence what I suppose may feel like collecting resources as keys to pay the costs necessary to pass Go and collect $200. Compared to the big focus on and lead up to distillation in Distilled, I think the moment-to-moment gamified prioritization of Arnak may be what contributes to your opinion (and correct me if I'm wrong), but I do personally prefer the latter.

This is paraphrased this from another explanation... somewhere... but it sounds to me like you're confusing
theme
with
realism.

To summarize, you mean to say that theme is the extent to which the setting permeates the art and verbiage, and realism is the verisimilitude of the gameplay, correct? I do not believe this redefinition is helpful. Arnak's art is incredible, easily some of the best in this medium, but I do not believe that recreating this game with stick figure art courtesy of MS paint would detract from all the mechanical ties I've discussed that relate to a fantastical expedition.

The more someone enjoys a theme, the more they can see connections to the theme through mechanics.

For me at least, enjoyment pertains negligibly to theme. I love space opera and spaceship combat—Legend of the Galactic Heroes is one of my favorite animations—but

Star Realms

, my favorite game, is distinctly sparse in that theme. There's even

high fantasy

and

Lovecraftian

reskins because the theme is so thin. By comparison,

Fast & Fhtagn

is hilariously thematic and also one of the worst games I've ever played.

Of course not all euros are thematic. But among those that are, I’ve never felt they somehow had “less” theme than games that are more in the thematic popular genres.)

I fully agree. I believe theme is a standalone quality that does not necessarily correlate to other factors in game design and quality.

(I feel like a lot of supposedly very thematic games all end up feeling like same-same dice chuckers, which I’m sure feels thematic to folks who like those things, but seldom does to me)

Though what defines theme may differ between people, I will happily defend my interpretation while seeking to learn from others.

Easy way to make Arnak a bit more thematic (at least for me) would have been to give the site tiles and guardian tiles some sort of name and maybe even a short description too. Just like they did (without the description) with the item cards.

Though I agree that describing the guardians and sites with names would have made referencing and remembering them much easier, I disagree that it would improve the theme or that remembering them is even desirable. The vivid art speaks for itself in describing guardians and sites alike, and for such names to exist and to be known to all competing players has strange implications, especially given that the Arnak language is implied to be largely unknown to the characters and that guardians are implied to be incapable of speech. It feels much more in-theme to me that you are presented with something truly unknown and have to categorize it yourself like a real explorer.

How did the word theme in up turning into "represents this concept as realistically as possible" instead of the word theme? What is the board game community even smoking at this point?
The theme makes perfect sense. Contextually everything you do lines up just fine with the theme. None of your questions have anything to do with theme. Why two workers can't fit in the same space is never a question theme needs to answer. Nor does it have anything to do with the theme. Any answer would be super contrived, reaching, if not down right silly and not anymore logical than just because. Its simply a waste of everyone's time to attempt to answer such a question. And to ask it.
Theme is the games theme. Thematic is how much the theme is gotten across in the context of your actions. Which is pretty strong given that you are conceptually traveling a huge area, gather ancient items, exploring the temple, logging it, and fighting monsters and shit.  Very ancient temple related things. The game and theme perfectly align.
At the end of the day, you are moving pieces of card board and wood around on a table. You are not an explorer, there are no daggers or tablets, nor monsters. You are at home not in some remote jungle. By your definition every board game every made is 0% thematic. No board game has ever contained any real elements of its theme. Even something like throw throw burrito doesn't contain an actual burrito. The theme isn't throw throw plushie, so it too, is an astounding 0% "thematic". Which is why its always been stupid to incorrectly define theme the way the board game community does. Jumanji is just a movie. Board games don't do that. Yall need to just stop and use the word theme correctly so its actually useful to talk about.

How did the word theme in up turning into "represents this concept as realistically as possible" instead of the word theme?

That's what I want to know. Did you read the title of the post? I am defending my interpretation of this nebulous and vague term.

What is the board game community even smoking at this point?

I don't use recreational drugs, but thanks for asking. I'll let others speak for themselves.

The theme makes perfect sense. Contextually everything you do lines up just fine with the theme.

Yes.

None of your questions have anything to do with theme.

No.

Its simply a waste of everyone's time to attempt to answer such a question. And to ask it.

"I don't care about this, and neither should you," is necessarily arguing in bad faith. I opened this thread because I wanted to review Arnak through the lens of how I believe it to be thematic, so commenting on my post calling it a waste of time is a self-defeating argument. You must care to put forth that effort.

Theme is the games theme.

Truisms are true. Whether they are helpful is another matter entirely.

The game and theme perfectly align.

Yes, I fully agree.

You are at home not in some remote jungle. By your definition every board game every made is 0% thematic.

No. You are strawmanning my position. I am not arguing about how well Arnak actually gets me to explore ruins in real life. You are suggesting that my position would be how Math Blaster! or Duolingo are some of the only thematic videogames because they are educational, and... that's silly. I am speaking of verisimilitude, of representation, of suspension of disbelief. Theme includes more than just art. Mechanics (which can also be considered art, but I digress) can represent theme, too, and Arnak does both well. Simulating the subject can be done in many ways: artistically through sensory input, mechanically through game design and incorporation of real-world concepts... abstraction does not necessarily subtract from etiher, just from the granularity of the detail present.
I don't play Arnak to defecate in the jungle.

To summarize, you mean to say that theme is the extent to which the setting permeates the art and verbiage, and realism is the verisimilitude of the gameplay, correct?

Ehh, not quite? I mean to say that theme is how the art and verbiage apply to the
mechanics
of the game. To the actual gameplay. For instance, strip theme away from the exploration mechanic in Arnak. It becomes:
"Use a blue-icon card and three green resources to unlock and move to a new board location. You receive some random resource rewards, but a random resource cost also appears. If you can pay it on a subsequent turn, you collect another reward. If you can't pay it, you get a penalty card."
Pretty exciting, huh?
But because Arnak applies its theme to all these things - it's not a 'blue-icon,' it's a boat, they're not 'green resources,' they're compasses, the 'penalty card' is fear, etc. - the mechanics feel less generic and make the action feel much more a part of the overall theme and concept of the game.

For me at least, enjoyment pertains negligibly to theme.

That may be true, but what I (and I believe others) are saying is that if you enjoy a game's theme - not in a generic sense, but
for that game specifically
- you may
look for
connections to the gameplay and mechanics that otherwise might be a little arbitrary.
Again, let's look at Arnak exploration. It costs 3 compasses to explore a L1 site. You say "well sure, you'd have to have compasses to navigate and find something in the deep jungle." You're invested in the theme, and you 'see' a story to explain how the mechanics apply to the action.
But what if exploration cost 2 compasses and 1 gold? A minor mechanical change, but thematically you'd likely say "obviously you need compasses, but an expedition also costs money, there's food and fuel and all that." You'd 'see' a slightly different story to explain the exact same action.
Most importantly, I think, is when someone loves a game's theme, it elevates their whole experience. And if someone is indifferent to (or actively dislikes) the theme, they often can't see past the mechanical bones. You see brave explorers using compasses to drive their boat down the river in search of the lost temple... someone else only sees blue icons and green resources.

I think you answered your own question through your replies. The answer is that perception of "thematic" varies by the individual and is a matter of taste. There's no rule that can be applied to define a game as thematic. I'm not sure there's much more to say.

Even in this abstracted example, the theme of exploration and facing an unknown threat with consequences for failure and rewards for success is clear. I suppose Distilled could be explained in this way as "A + B + optionally C yields bonus D equal to #A, then remove 2, pattern match, and gain numbers," with vague notes of chemistry, but that's not the point. Even without such terminology and art, wargames would be more thematic than something like

Dominion

as-is. I do agree that calling Arnak's coins "chocolate" and the compasses "sidewalk chalk" would make the game less thematic but only because that's an obviously bad explanation for something that could fit better. There is something present in these mechanics that lends to the words taking on special meaning in these contexts, and I believe that is also a factor in theme.

That may be true, but what I (and I believe others) are saying is that if you enjoy a game's theme - not in a generic sense, but
for that game specifically
- you may

I agree, but this is irrelevant to theme. Anyone who is passionate about something will spend more time thinking about it.

You are putting words in my mouth. That said, the game disagrees with the latter interpretation in the descriptions of these resources.
"Coins represent funding for your expedition. They are used to buy items.
Compasses represent time and energy spent exploring the island. Thus, they are used to discover artifacts and new archaeological sites."
To use an item on an expedtion, you can use it for its travel cost or if the effect allows you to activate a site in some way. You can't just chuck coins into the jungle and expect them to take you places... unless that is what it takes to placate a guardian.
If the game were different, it would be different, but it's not. It speaks for itself.

In my own words, that was the main point of my post.

However, my main point is that "thematic" games are ill-defined at best, a source of unspoken disagreement at worst. Likewise, I've seen many complaints that Lost Ruins of Arnak is not thematic, and I don't understand any of them.

In spite of this, everything I've claimed is a defense for my interpretation, and yet I've heard nothing that stands against it. I'm asking the community to disprove my theory, to test my claim, and it has emerged from the fire unscathed.

O-kay. I apologize, I missed that your goal here is "prove my subjective opinion is wrong," instead of "help me understand a concept."
I apologize for participating. Best of luck.

As I’ve seen it used, ‘theme’ denotes the cosmetics applied to a game that was not really designed primarily (if at all) to model the putative subject.
Abstraction is different from dissociation. The former has rather to do with degree of detail — often dependent on whether the model’s perspective is low- or high-level — whereas the latter means that causes and effects don’t match up with verisimilitude even after accounting for abstraction.
A model can be both very abstract and — perhaps for the sake of being a fun game — not a very accurate simulation, yet nonetheless clearly a model.
The degree of abstraction may contribute to it seeming dry or ‘unthematic’ to some people.
Sometimes that’s partly because because they don’t see how it reflects the designer’s thesis (a focus that leaves some aspects of the subject not explicitly called out, even though they may be “factored in” to the model).
Sometimes that’s because of lacking the veneer that would engage them in a video game or movie that was created with far less attention to the subject.
The design paradigm of starting with a subject and then constructing an abstraction as a model is arguably the most defining characteristic in the ‘Ameritrash’ cluster.
In the ‘Eurogame’ school, a design might take initial inspiration from a subject but the focus is on the abstract game qua game. A very different ‘theme’ might get applied in the course of development.
This distinction is just part of the array of characteristics, associated with one school or the other, that can tilt the scale clearly enough to one or the other side of the spectrum (despite whatever weighs in the other pan).
As with most things in life, there’s also a frontier domain in which a game is likely to get called a hybrid.
I think nigh everyone would agree that Lost Ruins of Arnak is clearly in the Eurogame domain.

What you've learnt is that you are correct there is no specific definition and there can't be. So the only way to understand why some say Arnak is not thematic is to look at it from another's perspective which is what some posters are trying to help you with. You have no theory to disprove as it isn't a theory, it's a realisation that there is no theory just perception and taste, ie it is subjective. Once you accept that you can try and see it from others perspectives why they think the way they do, an understanding. You don't have to agree, but you could attempt to see their perspective.

This games just doesn't deliver on evoking any of the indiana jones-esque pulpy atmosphere that it at surface lever seems to promise. It's incredibly dry and if you removed the theme all together it wouldn't really have a huge impact on the feel of the game. Theme is aesthetic, and the theme of this game is at best skin deep.

Are the site rewards taken Simultaneously or one after one, because some tiles have Tablett tokens and a trade sign on it and I want to trade one of the reward directly?

Suppose I use the fishing rod when I have no actual gold,and discover that the top card of the item deck costs 4. Can I generate gold as a fast effect in order to buy it ?

Suppose I use the fishing rod when I have no actual gold,and discover that the top card of the item deck costs 4. Can I generate gold as a fast effect in order to buy it ?

Assuming by 'fast effect' you mean free action:
The rules (page 8) say you can do 'free actions' (with lightning symbol) anytime: before, after or even during your main action.
Page 22 also states that you can use fishing rod and choose not to buy anything.

Thanks !

BGA doesn't allow this, which is frustrating, because it's perfectly legal.

The reason might be that it is too tough to program.

Has anyone summarised icons from all expansions in one sheet?

In the files section Action Andy placed updated rulesheet including Both expansions, on the second page you find all icons.

Hi. When I opened up my box, the rulebook mentioned that there would be 9 gems, 12 arrowheads and 16 tablets. However, I got 10 gems, 13 arrowheads and 17 tablets. Has anyone else experienced this or did I just luck out?

I can't be sure because I don't think I ever counted mine.
But you can count yourself lucky and carry on!

Same as mine.
I call it "CGE's thoughtfulness".

Sometimes games come with extras; no big deal. The exact number you have does not matter (i.e. no rule is triggered if a resource runs out; they are conceptually unlimited).

I guess it's better for them to accidentally add too many than too few

Sometimes games come with extras; no big deal. The exact number you have does not matter (i.e. no rule is triggered if a resource runs out; they are conceptually unlimited).

It is literally stated in the rules:

rulebook, page 23

Reserve Tiles
The ×3 multiplier tiles are intended for use if you are close to running out of tokens. Each token on the tile counts as 3.
Tokens on the supply board are not intended to be limited.

Same as mine.
I call it "CGE's thoughtfulness".

Also see the spare tokens strip in

I just unboxed Tzolk'in (also from CGE) and I had 68 wooden cubes when the rules say 65.  I think they are just in the habit of throwing in a few extras.

I got two sets of gold coins, IIRC I got 54 instead of 27.

Same! There was another cardboard sheet of just coins

My copy has a little, deformed half tablet piece. A little runt compared to the others. I know it was a mistake but I love it. It's like a little mascot


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say I have a nice pile of tokens and I have enough to move up twice during my Research action. Is this allowed or does the second move have to be done as a separate action on another turn? Or can you only move up once during your turn?

One main action per turn. No matter which main action it is.
The rules are very clear, page 7 and 14.
"A research action moves one of your research tokens up to the next row of the research track"

"A research action moves one of your research tokens up to the next row of the research track"

Correct!
There is an edge case where moving up the track results in gaining an artifact, which may allow you to move up the research track. Which will end up with more than 1 research track movement a turn.
But as was said above only 1 instance of 1 main action a turn.

Just like you cannot buy more than one item card per turn, or place both your workers per turn, or overcome two guardians per turn, etc.

Does anyone else feel the Guardians are too easy when you get to the Level 2 sites? Was wondering if anyone had created harder Guardians to play with?

Not really, rather, view it as your arnakologists getting more familiar with the island and its secrets.

Why would you need tougher Guardians? The level 2 sites are tougher on their own, both to explore and to visit, regardless of any Guardians, and the goal of the game is not that you become the best dragontamer of all time.
Should you want to make them tougher, place some resource tokens of all types in a bag and draw one for each of the level II Guardians as an additional task. Score 1 or 2 additional VPs for each level 2 Guardian. But that said, my best advice is to play the game as it is designed.

The sites are deeper in the jungle, doesn't mean the guardians should be tougher (why shouldnt tougher guardians show up at easier to reach sites)

While it might make some sense thematically, the rewards are not balanced for that. Perhaps if the buffed level 2 guardians also gave a buffed boon? Maybe an interesting thing to try in a homemade variant.

Could be fun if you had to face 2 Guardians, but that would probably make the lvl 2 sites too good (they're already super good to go to).

You'd need to redesign a different set of Guardians worth more points if that were the case, maybe something like 5 rss for 7VP. That's a lot of effort for a minor thematic payoff. The current system keeps things far more streamlined and easier to balance.
Also, war club and bear trap would be way too good at fighting tier 2 guardians and will need to be errata-ed.

I agree.

Could be fun if you had to face 2 Guardians, but that would probably make the lvl 2 sites too good (they're already super good to go to).

One of the scenarios in the free solo campaign does this: It even places three guardians on the level 2 site. However, I've found it was still fairly easy to defeat all three in a single round, so it's actually a boon!

I recently played Arnak for the first time after seeing the comparison on forums and articles, and as I played I was comparing the two in my own mind as well.
I've seen a lot of folks draw lines of commonality—likely because Dune Imperium and Lost Ruins of Arnak combine worker placement and deckbuilding—and an equal number of folks disavow any similarities and deride the very comparison.
And so I wanted to start a discussion on that schism and explore why the games are linked, and more importantly illustrate the differences and similarities to lead more people to play and experience both.
Why are they so frequently talked about?
1. They use similar mechanics.
That's it. And that's okay. You're gonna talk about Quacks when you talk about Push-Your-Luck or Simultaneous Turns and that's FINE. I don't think "Arnak and Dune are nothing alike" is a particularly defensible position, yet I've seen it a lot.
If you've played Dune, you can describe Arnak like this:
"It's like Dune except there's no interaction aside from blocking each other on certain spaces. Like if you removed the Conflict from Dune, it'd be sorta like that.
Also if you make it so you can still do a lot of things without an Agent, like if you could afford something with Solari or Spice, you could buy it without having to send someone to a space.
And it's gentler and more generous in its deckbuilding, like when you buy certain things you activate them immediately, and generally anything you buy goes INTO your deck instead of discard so you'll almost definitely draw and enjoy its effects next round.
Oh, and Arnak is usually shorter by a wide margin."
So it's a gentler, less-interactive Dune (unless you're a madman and go for Snake Temple, which just tightens everything we've just talked about).
And if you've played Arnak, the bridge to Dune is clear: more interaction, more constrained and consequential turns, less-forgiving deckbuilding.
Ultimately, I would say the point of this post is to say that I believe it's reasonable to talk about these two games in the same breath. Leaving out Conflict, they do feel similar to play to me.
So why not talk about them together? Why do people feel so fervently compelled to shout that they're not the same thing?
I love both, and I see them both as worth owning, even if I think they're very similar.

Disagree that base game

is shorter than base game

by a wide margin. 3 or 4 experienced Imperium players can easily complete a game in two hours. Note that Imperium’s endgame can be triggered early — the full ten rounds ain’t necessarily so. On the other hand Arnak’s players MUST complete full five rounds.

A further similarity between

and Arnak’s first expansion,

, is both have Leaders with variable player powers.

Thanks for your perspective! Every group varies of course. In my experience with the two games at various player counts, Arnak comes up shorter by a considerable amount. You’re of course right that Imperium has a variable end and Arnak needs 5, but even with the possibility of several ‘extra’ Arnak phases, I’d be surprised if the average game time per player (“experienced” or otherwise) were higher in Arnak than in Dune.
Would love to have other folks chime in on this point for sure. Are your Dunes longer than your Ruins??

A further similarity between

and Arnak’s first expansion,

, is both have Leaders with variable player powers.

I am realizing now that I was mostly thinking of Uprising which doesn’t change the calculus much.
I’d also say that having played both versions with both expansions, the game that feels most similar to Arnak is Base plus Immortality. What do you think?
Whole other can of worms to invite the expansions into the conversation and I love it! Delicious worms, imo.

Fixed it for you.
Occasionally I use

+

with 18 Leaders (7 Leaders borrowed from

& 2 Leaders borrowed from

). In a 3-player game each one is randomly dealt 6 Leaders, picking their favourite. (In a 4-player game each one is randomly dealt 4 Leaders.)
Whether or not I add Immortality to Uprising, I always use Immortality’s Family Atomics when playing Uprising.

So why not talk about them together? Why do people feel so fervently compelled to shout that they're not the same thing?

I do like to make a big deal of the differences when telling people about them, because I worry some may, because they are so often compared, think that if they like one they'll like the other. And that just isn't necessarily true.

Would love to have other folks chime in on this point for sure. Are your Dunes longer than your Ruins??

Our Ruins are longer than our Dunes, because Ruins gives us AP in a way that Dune does not.

unless you're a madman and go for Snake Temple

Snake Temple forever!

Yes, the two games scratch two different itches (although I personally am Itchy & Scratchy).

I am looking forward to playing the two exotic and esoteric Temples included in the second expansion,

I am making a strenuous effort NOT to buy the second expansion until I've tried everything in the first expansion. But I have very little willpower when it comes to this sort of thing. I expect the solo campaign to rock my world.

First, either game with AP-prone players is going to run long. That's inevitable. But both games can inflict AP, so in that regard it's a bit of wash. But I think each game's length really depends on the player's familiarity with the game.
Overall, I think Dune takes more time with new players, and less for experienced ones. There's a good deal to learn and the race-to-10VP nature of it can be daunting for new players, and experienced players usually know what they want to try and do from the jump. Not to mention, as Hilda noted, they can often end the game before 10 turns.
With Anrak, it's the reverse - new players don't see (or use) all of the ways to optimize their turns, so rounds go quickly. But experienced players make the most of those optimizations and can stretch each round out longer and longer. Since it's always 5 rounds, it's shorter with new players and longer with experienced ones.

Oh, very well said! I have been playing Dune with newer folks lately, so that would explain why my brain's leaning that way but most folks are chiming in to say Ruins runs longer.
I think ultimately what I should've made clearer is that saying something like "they're completely different" and leaving it there doesn't push people toward trying them. I think there's a lot of overlap in terms of what feels good about playing each of them! So having "vetted" comparison/contrast statements about the two games is something I'm glad to have now.
Thanks for contributing and reflecting, folks!

Dune Imperium is on my top 10 list, in part because it feels like no other game in my collection.  I crave that kind of originality, and it's super fun, too.  On the other hand, I'm considering trading away Lost Ruins of Arnak because it feels like a generic resource management game to me.  This is not to say it's not enjoyed by a wide audience, each for their own legitimate reasons, but this does speak to how different the two games are.

has five different resources, which in my opinion is a tad too many.

Maybe I have a broader view on this.
Arnak, Ark Nova, Dune Imperium, and even Tyrants of the Underdark or Clank are all of the same species. That's how I treat them.
At first, it was Dominion followed by Thunderstone and Ascension. Pure deckbuiding with a common pool of cards. Later, the board was added. Arnak uses the board for meeple placement and those nice tracks on the right, Ark Nova - personal boards for zoos and tableau building, Dune Imperium - meeple placement and area control, Tyrants - pure area control. All are united by the "most points wins", inherited from predessors.
There is a certain similarity between each of them, because they all carry Dominion in the cores and develop it. Under a microscope, one can detect more similarities, like a number of meeples in Dune Imperium and Arnak. But, in my opinion, these are completely different games.

But, in my opinion, these are completely different games.

Well this is sort of what the whole question is, and as another person said “to each their own.” But I don’t know if “completely different” is completely defensible. If the two games share worker placement and deckbuilding and combine them in much the same way (use the card to place the guy), and both are in the top 20 of all time here on BGG, they’re just not “completely different.”
If someone asked you “I love Arnak, is Dune similar at all” what would you say?
I’ve never heard Dune called area control… You mean the control flags?

As a broad view in terms of game concepts, there are similarities. As a broad view of actual game mechanics... not so much. They all have cards and meeples, but they use them quite differently.
Arnak and Dune = deckbuilding + worker placement. Keep in mind, this was a pretty novel combination way back in 2020, when both were released. The feel of the games are different, but how they work is very similar, hence all the recommendations.
Clank! = deckbuilding + point-to-point movement. You have one meeple that moves around on the board/map. This uses different mechanics but has a similar feel of exploration. I think this (or any Clank! title) is a decent recommendation.
Tyrants of the Underdark = deckbuilding + area control/influence. You have a lot of meeples and you're fighting over parts of the board. Not quite a wargame, but much more confrontational. Very different feel, but might be a good recommendation who wants 'Arnak but meaner.'
Ark Nova = This isn't a deckbuilder, and wooden bits are really only used as trackers. This really belongs with other tableau-builders like Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, Earth, etc. Ark Nova is also a much longer game. I think if someone wants a game like Arnak and you suggest this, they will be very confused.
If you see all those games as the same species, so be it. But, in keeping with your taxonomic ranking, I'd argue many are different species within the same genus, and Ark Nova is from a whole other family.

But, in my opinion, these are completely different games.

Okay, maybe not completely, but they does not have too much in common except for certain mechanics and central pool deck-building. Dune is more strategic, Arnak is more of a euro-style. Playing a card to place a meeple is not so rare. The games have
a different feel and strategic choices.
If someone asks me... Depends on who asks. I would not recommend Dune to a person who is not a strategy fan.

Technically, no deck. Practically, Ark Nova adheres to the same principles of acquiring and using cards as deck-builders do. In this game, the deck is simply replaced with a tableau. But I have to agree that this is a controversial point.

On the main points, I agree.
I feel the same way about Ars Nova as I do about these games (I've explained the reasons above). This is the first game that I would recommend to a person who loves Arnak (definitely not Earth or Winspan). But I agree that this is a very controversial point. For a wide range of reasons.
in addition to what has been mentioned, Dune is also a combat-shaped auction. Very few VPs compared to the scoring games like Arnak. Many resources, but not so many elegant manipulations and indirect conversion of one into another. Not an area control in a pure form, but combines the accessibility based on the cards and the top positions in the scoring tracks into dominating in conflicts and VPs. Intrigue cards that root in a military strategy. Etc.

Hi, I'd like to know what could be considered a good (competitive) score for this game, without any expansions.
Thanks

Any 70  over score…

This could help

Cool tool!

BrujaLouder

75, 80, 85...

Yep. This sounds about right for the snake temple in my experience.

I would consider 80+ on snake temple or 85+ on bird temple to be the lower end of 'good' scores.

This could help
https://goodat.games/

I like it!
Using this chart I consider any score over 66 as "good" and over 80 "exceptional"
But more importantly did I and my opponent(s) enjoy our visit to Arnak?

Admittedly that is a cool site. I assume it is pulling stats from BGA?
Amusing how the Ark Nova scores include both scoring systems. Also when filtering by place and entering a score, I can be judged as terrible for a game that I won.

A score in the 80s is good. A score in the 90s is good and probably wins the game. A score over 100 is extremely good.

Heheh, well of course the best score is n+1, where n is what the second place player got.
But Arnak is a game where a 'good' score can reasonably be assessed in isolation. Defensive tactics are few, so there is little scope to lock down a low scoring win. You can take your foot off the gas in the last round and coast home with a lower score yourself, but you can't reduce their score by much.
Rachel's assessment is decent. I would expect 90 to win almost always. 100+ is just rubbing it in

I'd say 90 is more than good, it's excellent (backed up by it being the 97th percentile) and 100 is freakishly good (100th percentile). If you're regularly scoring 100, you are probably one of the best Arnak players worldwide.

If you're regularly scoring 100, you are probably one of the best Arnak players worldwide.

Or you’re playing against not-so-great opponents.

I suppose that can help, but 100 is rare in any case.

While the tool quoted above is great, many players "post" their scores to BGG through third party apps or website, in addition many people combine their lost expedition co-op scores into their base game scores, and on top of that I think its fair to say that player count makes a significant difference due to blocking.
All of the above being said, I would say as follows;
50 - Did you forget your waterbottle? Missing a sole on a boot too, yikes!
55 - Whip got caught in the entrance to the cave, stumbled through in the dark, just about escaped with no loot.
60 - Got a flat tyre on the car on the way up, sorted that, but then ran out of fuel on the way back.
65 - Spider bite to one explorer, everyone else okay, managed to grab an artifact
70 - Everyone got home safe, but could have been better prepared, managed to grab a tablet.
75 - Managed to reap some rewards, everyone is tired now but very successful, journal worthy stuff.
80 - Have you seen the size of this Ruby?
85 - Made a trade of shiny things with a giant stone owl, came back with some valuable artifacts
90 - You know that scene in Indiana Jones where he escapes with the golden egg? Yeah, I did that.
95 - "He chose... wisely"
100+ - So this is what the Temple Of Artemis looks like.
TL;DR: Outside of the (hopefully clearly jovial ranking) I would say below 60 is a poor, 61-70 is okay, 71-75 is standars, 76-80 is good, 81 to 89 is very good and over 90 is excellent.

A score in the 80s is good. A score in the 90s is good and probably wins the game. A score over 100 is extremely good.

Do you suggest, therefore, that about three quarters of the scores on the chart are not good enough?

I was looking at my previous games and every winning score was over 80, with the exception of a single win in at 75. So based off those results, I stand by what I said. A score in the 80s is good (aka may win the game). If it's snake side, I guess you could subtract 5-10 from those numbers.
The website with the histogram is nice, but it provides few filtering options. I would like to see filtered data of only experienced players (players that have played at least 5 times already), of Bird side only or Snake side only, at 2p, 3p, and 4p separate.

I'd say 90 is more than good, it's excellent (backed up by it being the 97th percentile) and 100 is freakishly good (100th percentile). If you're regularly scoring 100, you are probably one of the best Arnak players worldwide.

Even more than that - said person would probably be cheating (either intentionally or unintentionally). The top ranked players (Master tier) on BGA don't even average 90. You can actually stalk their profiles and stats if you have BGA premium btw.

There is no obvious threshold for "good" or even a "winning" score (I've won a game scoring 62). It is definitely possible for very good players to score 85-90 fairly consistently, but I wouldn't expect anyone new to the game to get anywhere near there. Also, many factors affect score:
* Temple: Bird is easiest, Lizard and Snake are a bit harder, Monkey gives very low scores; I don't know about Tree and Waterfall.
* Use of leaders from the expansions probably add 5-10 points depending on skill.
* The game isn't super-high in interaction, but the skill of your opponents, especially in a 2-player game, does have an effect.
* The chapters from the free solo campaign and the new expansion campaign both change a lot of rules, which affects score quite a lot.

After buying an Artifact you can resolve its effect immediately, ignoring the cost of paying a Tablet.
But I want to use the Plane icon.  Is that possible?
I don't understand what the "Note' means exactly at page 12:
When you buy an artifact, you get to resolve its effect. That effect might be another action,
like sending an archeolist to dig at a site
. All this is considered to be part of your main action for the turn.
So can I use the Plane to send an archeolist to a site immediately? Or can I take the card in hand and use it in a next turn? Or can't I use the Plane at all, only when I get it in my hand next time?

Or can't I use the Plane at all, only when I get it in my hand next time?

This. Your main action is buying the artifact (and resolving its effect.) Using the plane for travel cost would be part of a different main action.

When you buy an artifact you
- resolve its effect immediately for free (no tablet cost)
- put it in your "play area", meaning it has been used this round and cannot be used for anything (so not its travel icon, nor its effect) before you draw it again in a follow up round
the note on page 12 is to give an example of what are artifact effect, but it has nothing to do with its travel icon. It could have been "gain XXX resource" instead of the "send your archeologist to dig a site" they choose as an example

Keep in mind, while can't use the artifact's travel icon when you purchase the card, later on, you can use the card for its travel icon only and not pay a tablet to activate the card's effect.

Dear all,
I have saved money by nit backing a recent KS.
So, Lost Ruins beckons me.
For solo only, whete to begins.
Is it a question of starting with the base set and adding expansions later?
Do you combine expansions one at time?
A brief 'Just buy it all and read the instructions' might suffice.
I just need a small kick to get me on the right track.
Thank you.

The base game of

is an excellent solo experience. When it is the robot’s turn simply flip its tile, then execute its action.

I'd recommend:
- get the base game, play it a few times to check you like it and see if you'll be satisfied with just that box or want more content
- if you want more, get

which adds a solo six-scenario campaign along with two unique leaders for a some variety
- if you enjoy the leaders in that expansion, get

which has six more leaders, any of which can be used in basic games or in the campaign (as is true of the two leaders in Missing Expedition)

. level 1 Solo with base game few times
. level 2 Solo with
https://czechgames.com/en/lost-ruins-of-arnak/solo/
only base game
. Level 3 Solo with first expansion, 6 leaders and a lot of possibilities
. Level 4 Solo with second expansion, 4 more leaders, use the old and the new leaders with the old/new temple tracks
. Level 5 Campaign with the second expansion solo or co-op, similar to the campaign base (but much better) plus + chapters for a total of 6
. Level 6 Waiting new expansion to be announced ..
Tip: once you play with leaders it's rare that you want to play the base game only anymore

Hi All,
I have a similar question and thought I should add it here instead of starting a new thread.
My question is also from a place of wanting to start trying solo but is about 'how?'
I have the base game and the Leaders expansion. The base game has solo rules but I found nothing in the Leaders expansion about solo rules. I have looked through some forum entries and found out there is a newer manual that has a small section about solo.
I watched a YouTube clip of someone playing solo with Leaders - and they were using an app - and the app was using goals for the AI that I cannot find mentioned in either the base game solo instructions or the updated Leaders manual. The video creator also proceeded to say the app had a bug in it and didn't follow 'the solo instructions' properly.
Can someone recommend a solo approach for me?

The solo rules and tiles that come with the base game work perfectly well with the leaders expansion. I haven’t tried the app, so I can’t comment on what it may have for AI goals in addition to the base tiles. I do think it has the purple “extra hard” tiles available, since the red and green tiles in the base game can be a bit easy to beat at times.

Can someone recommend a solo approach for me?

Why wouldn't you simply start with the base game's solo variant?

I really like the Leaders expansion and would like to play solo using the new content.
If you are asking 'why not use the base game variant with the expansion?' - then it's because I wasn't sure this was a good option since often a game expansion will change the way solo is played (and the YouTube clip had something different).

It might help if you shared the YouTube video you're referring to. The solo mode doesn't change with the Leaders expansion, as far as I can tell.  Was the TouTube clip referring to the solo campaign, perhaps?  The solo campaign, either online or using the Missing Expedition expansion, changes up how the automa player functions based on the scenario being played.

This is the clip:

At about the 3 minute mark you can see Rival Objectives. I don't think I've seen these in the box - but happy for someone to say I must have missed them.

Please spell it out for me. I'm trying to understand the relationship between what is in the YouTube clip and the base game solo instructions?
So the Rival Objectives are not part of the official solo but part of a print and play variation?

Explore a lost island in this beautiful, surprisingly thematic worker-placement / deck-building board game
You can also find this review on the
I Love Board Games Website

Overview

The Lost Ruins of Arnak is a hybrid worker placement and deck-building game. It’s one of a tandem of such games that came out in 2020, the other being the perhaps slightly more famous

Dune: Imperium

(both are solidly in the BoardGameGeek Top 100 ranked games of all-time). I’m not going to compare the two—let me know if you’d like that as a follow-up article in the comments—but they play very differently, and there’s room for both in your collection.





Artwork and Presentation

The first thing you’ll notice when setting up is the fabulous artwork. The board art and graphic design are clear, the cards and guardians in particular stand out for their artwork, and many of the components are a delight (the cardboard gold and compass tokens stick out as exceptions, and there are many upgrade options on Etsy). The artwork invites you in and does a lot of heavy lifting to make the game feel thematic as you explore new locations on the island, encounter guardians, purchase new items and artifacts, and advance on the temple track.
It’s such a beautiful game, you may even forget this is a Euro game where you’re pushing wooden pieces around the board. And speaking (writing?) of the mechanics…

Mechanics

As mentioned, the game is often called a worker placement deck-building game. Those are some primary mechanics, but there’s quite a bit going on. It’s also a resource management game with several resource types to gather, convert, and spend to maximize the efficiency of their turns. It’s also a track game where a significant source of your points is drawn from exploring and investigating a temple (two are available in the base game, and two more come from the Expedition Leaders expansion) depicted by racing two unique markers per player up a branching and merging track. It’s like if Indiana Jones became an accountant…but in a fun way.



While there's no die rolling in the game, you can dive into the unknown by exploring near areas and far areas with your workers to add worker placement spots that any player can later access in future rounds.
This isn’t even to mention the market of items and artifacts you use to build your deck, nor how your cards have multiple uses as either travel icons to place your workers or placing for effects, or how it all builds into a little engine that crescendos right as the game snaps off its fifth and final round. In clumsier hands, this would turn into a heavy euro game with a tremendous amount to manage and significant downtime between turns. But
Arnak
streamlines turns to be snappy, with really only a few options on any given turn. It’s certainly not a light game, and I wouldn’t recommend playing it with non-gamer family members, but gamers will have no problem picking it up and getting going before too long.

The basic flow of the game looks like this: you start with few resources, some basic cards, and two archaeologists (workers). There are a few basic uncovered locations to go to and gather resources available. Throughout the round, you will place your workers and play cards to gain enough resources of the right types to advance in your investigation of the temple and discover new locations. That will uncover guardians and overcoming those (again, with resources) will gain you points. There’s also a market where you can spend gold or compasses to gain new items for your deck—unlike most deck-builders, these are placed at the bottom of your deck, not in your discard pile. You’ll play until all players pass, five times, then the game is over. This will take ~1–2 hours depending on player count, teaching time, and how long it takes your buddy to decide between getting a gold or a compass.

Expedition Leaders

The first expansion for
Lost Ruins of Arnak
is
Expedition Leaders
. Each of those titular leaders adds asymmetry to the game, ranging from very basic and light to a bit more complex and heavy. They never actually range into the _heavy_ range, but there are a few that I wouldn’t recommend teaching to a newcomer to the game. The leaders each provide cards, a player board, and a core “hook”. The Falconer has a hawk with a little track that the player can advance and pull back to gain some extra resources.

The Explorer only gets one archaeologist worker but can move that worker around the board within the round, potentially re-opening spots opponents through blocked off.

The Professor has expanded abilities to get and use artifacts (the blue cards in the market).

Still another (the mysterious Mystic) can generate fear (normally mostly worthless cards worth minus one point at the end of the game) and then burn them in a fire for bonus resources. These leaders add another element to consider and expand the replayability of
Arnak
.
## Review
Lost Ruins of Arnak
has become one of my favorite board games. It has a wonderful mix of individually simple mechanisms that blend into a beautiful web of decisions players have. There’s light interaction between the players—grabbing cards from the market that others may want, blocking up worker spaces, and grabbing bonus resources in the race up the temple, but it’s certainly not a "take that" game. That means players mostly get to look at what they’re doing, but they do have to be cognizant of other players’ boards.

If I purchase that card from the market, what round(s) will I draw it in? The cap of five rounds means you’ll only see each card a handful of times, but the unique draw structure means that you will not be buying cards in round 2 that luck dictates you’ll never see. Should I build up to explore a new space? If I do, will an opponent grab it next round at a serious discount? How much should I push each marker on the temple for their unique rewards? The variability and, dare I say, randomness in the game take the game out of the heavy strategy of many euro games and give it a much more tactical feel. Your short-term decisions and reactions to random rewards will determine how well you fare just as much as your long-term planning.
This isn’t the perfect game for everybody. It’s a few steps above family weight. The interaction of the cards and workers, combined with the multiple resources and market, will make it too chaotic-feeling for newer players to the hobby. It’s also a few steps below games like

Brass: Birmingham
,



Ark Nova

, and

Hegemony

. It’s right about the weight of something like

Everdell

, and some gamers who like deep, meaty strategy in their games are going to find it a bit too tactical. Without the first expansion, the charge of invariability between games holds some merit as well. The two sides of the board offer a unique experience (one slightly more welcoming than the other)—but not
that
unique.

Once you factor in Expedition Leaders, however, you now have four temples and six asymmetric leaders to explore and charges of uniformity of gameplay start to fall away. There are also criticisms leveled against the game that the temple track is all-important for points. I don’t entirely disagree (though I don’t entirely agree either), but I think it provides a nice focus for players who enjoy mid-weight Euro games and prevents
Arnak
from turning into a point-salad game.

Final Thoughts

For players of games like

Wingspan

, I sincerely believe
Arnak
offers an excellent step-up into mid-weight Euro games. The presentation, like that of Wingspan, really draws players in and does a lot of the heavy lifting to make the game feel thematic instead of another mid-weight resource conversion Euro. The mix of exploration, resource management, deck-building, and racing provides a tremendous experience. Without the Expedition Leaders expansion, I do think that repeated plays will probably wind up with players feeling like they’ve gotten everything out of the game, but with it, players will have new mechanics and experiences to explore for a long time to come.

Sure both

and

have variable player powers, and have hybrid worker-placement and deck-building, but other than those commonalities they are completely different games.

Hilda is spot-on. I've seen the two games compared because they share mechanics, but gameplay is wildly different
Beneath all the theming, Arnak is a pretty straightforward euro, with many paths and methods of collecting points. I wouldn't quite call it a point salad type of game - it's a bit more puzzle-y and deliberate - but definitely a euro under the hood. Whereas Dune: Imperium is a flat-out race to 10 points, everything is tight and tense.

I couldn't tell if Hilda was being sarcastic
But yes, the games have very different feels despite a few similar mechanics. D:I's race makes it feel more deliberative—every action matters, and it's stingier with resources. Arnak feels lighter and a bit freer, while still having a tight economy and race up the temple track..
In other words D:I feels much more strategic and requiring long-term planning, while Arnak is more tactical and requires reacting to changing conditions far more frequently. It's not that D:I has no tactics and Arnak no strategy, they just have completely different emphases and feels.

Are there fan made expansions to add more leaders to the game?
Any official expansion with new characters planned?
Thanks

Check the variants section, some fan did a nice job making some extra leaders

Playtesters do but can't speak (yet) about it

At least 4 new leaders would be awesome

Check this:

Bloody hell.  Don't they know how many hours some of us have sweated over the Herculean task of making the first two expansions fitting into the base game box?

Hi, is LRoA or

Pirates of Maracaibo

better for 2 players ? Theme wise, I like both. But I don't want something too heavy (2.5 to 2.8 on BGG seems to be an ok spot for us), and I don't know which is the most difficult to learn and play. Is Pirates of Maracaibo interesting enough against that mastodont which is LRoA ?

2-player

is particularly interesting with the variable player powers introduced by its first expansion,

I played this game 40+ times with my wife and we can't get enough! The first expansion is essential, the second is also really fun because it turns a competitive game into a co-operative one! We are almost finishing the campaign!

Hello,
Any suggestions for replacing the compass tokens with something like real compass buttons(Amazon, Alixpress)?
I have some concerns that the liquid might leak into the box.
Thank you

lots of options on etsy!

There are already some threads about that kind of upgrades.
Some of them show the upgrades, some others only have external links (which may or may not be valid today).

I have little mini compasses. They don't all point north, but the liquid has not escaped them.
Definitely a cool game component.

I wish future expansion would contain upgrades compass and coin tokens.

The rule say:
Using Assistants
“To use your assistant turn it sideways. A Sideways assistant is exhausted until the end of the round. All Assistants are refreshed at the end of the round. Certain cards allow the assistant to be refreshed during the round and used again.”
On the research board there is an upgrading assistant to Gold.
Rules say “when you move your notebook to a row with this symbol (gold assistant icon) upgrade
one
of your assistants to the gold level (flip it to the gold side) at this time the assistant is refreshed even if it’s silver effect was used earlier in the round”
If I already have an assistant that’s in gold does that mean I can only upgrade the remaining assistant or could I use the refresh option on the research track to refresh an already used gold assistant.

That would be correct about being able to upgrade the second assistant to gold side and use again (if turned on its side previously) You can not upgrade an assistant that already upgraded to the gold side. So it could not be used again for that purpose. Only an effect by card, guardian (defeated), idiol or end of round can refresh the gold sided assistant .

Thank you that’s what I was kinda thinking
but wanted to verify with everyone.

Totally understandable and I have used the forums couple of times my self.

hello
When you get for example a tablet and a trade effect, can you apply the trade effect on the tablet you just got or do you have to use the trade effect on a tablet you already have?
Thanks
F.

You can use the trade effect on the tablet you just got.
In other words, you could consider getting a "tablet + trade effect" the same as getting an arrowhead.

Thanks a lot, that's how I played it but I was not sure

Note too that the upgrade is optional.  So many times I've seen players upgrade an arrowhead to a ruby, and then needed the arrowhead to overcome the guardian.

Note too that the upgrade is optional.  So many times I've seen players upgrade an arrowhead to a ruby, and then needed the arrowhead to overcome the guardian.

Sure, but do note that you have to choose to upgrade or not before you can see the guardian.

ok you go to a new site , you take an idol with an upgrade symbol, can you upgrade a tablet you will get by digging the new site?

Strictly, no.
1. Travel to a new site
2. Take the idol and
immediately
resolve its effect.
3. Discover the site.
4. Reveal the guardian.
See those steps on page 10 of the rulebook.

thanks!

the rules say no, you can't. officially you must take the idol or both idols at the same moment and trigger the effects immediately.
Hence, if all players agree, it's ok to do your way. it's up to you


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the rules don't seem to specifically confirm or deny, I just wanted to be sure that I am playing correctly:
- Startup resources are ONLY given at the beginning of the game (i.e. - the first round), NOT at the beginning of every round
-When you send your archaeologist to dig at a previously discovered, but now unoccupied  Tier 1 or 2 site that has no guardian present*, you do NOT place a guardian there
*e.g. in solo mode when the Rival action tile directed it to discover a site but not place a guardian there
Thanks

1. You are right.
2. You are right. This also applies to multiplayer game.

Both correct.

Thanks

1. See page 17 for the setup for each round, it does not mention getting starting resources.
2. See page 21, solo rules.
"The newly discovered site gets a site tile, as you would expect.
The site gets a guardian only in certain rounds, as indicated

Your answer 2. is not an answer to @zygg's question.
The part you are referring to is the Rival's action tile @zygg mentions.
But that tile only specifies what the Rival does when it is discovering a new site. In some cases the Rival only discovers a new site, but doesn't place a guardian at that new site.
The best answer is the same as your answer 1.
There is no mention placing new guardians when digging at a (already discovered) site:

Rulebook, page 9

Dig at a Site
As your main action for your turn, you can send one of your archaeologists to dig at any of the 5 sites. You will also be able to dig at [level I] and [level 2] sites after they have been discovered.
To Dig at a Site
1. Pay the travel cost depicted on the space to which you want to send your archaeologist. The space must be unoccupied.
2. Move your archaeologist from your player board to that space.
3. Resolve the effect depicted at the site.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you get the boot for instant usage or do you get it for later (  it becomes available the same way a plane on a guardian you have overcome )  ?
In other words what is the difference between a travel right : boot, plane, …  ( card, overcome guardian ) and a travel right on a free action ( assistant ) ? If any

Do you get the boot for instant usage or do you get it for later (  it becomes available the same way a plane on a guardian you have overcome )  ?
In other words what is the difference between a travel right : boot, plane, …  ( card, overcome guardian ) and a travel right on a free action ( assistant ) ? If any

When you use assistant effect, you can use the boot anytime during your turn, but your turn only. You cannot keep it for a later turn.
So you can use it in any action you're performing during your turn
[edit] This has been clarified in the Expedition Leader expansion rulebook, in the last page.

rulebook p24

DON’T FORGET!
- [...]
- If an effect generates a travel value that you cannot use immediately, you may still use it at any time before the end of your turn.

the balance of cards content involving coins，gems，compasses and others  is so good. But the part about delating cards and drawing cards seems to be out of balance.
obviously , delation and draw is equal to 1 value. howerer they seem to be a top  1value-resource in the author's eyes, and the cards associated with them are particularly low in strentgh. these weak cards like TURTLE, AXE ,CLAW HOOK, DONKEY，SOLDIER KNIFE and so on are hardly chosen by people. these cards are so funny, i like the author's design very much  but i am upset that no people chose them.  And the same thing happened to drawing assistant，the one that will never be chosen.
is there some way to rejuvenate these bleak cards？

about most weak item cards， i think the key is they are too expensive. if TURTLE or REVOLVER could be cheaper，there must be lots of people like them.

Are we talking about balance from a competitive viewpoint?

Are we talking about balance from a competitive viewpoint?

FWIW I think OP is clearly talking only about "balance" in the sense of whether all
cards
are similarly valuable, not in the sense of competitive balance like first player advantage.

obviously , delation and draw is equal to 1 value. howerer they seem to be a top  1value-resource in the author's eyes,

Does 'delation' mean exile - removing a card from play? Exile is worth more than 1 point. You (usually) exile a fear card which is a point and also improves your future hands. Card draw is worth 1 when a coin or compass is drawn, less when a fear is drawn, and usually more when an item or artifact is drawn. On average, this is more than 1.

I've started to come around to drawing cards like Pack Donkey (4 coins/draw 2) IF I have a strong deck and IF I can get it for free, e.g. Airdrop, the free item monster reward, 3 coin discount from Fishing Rod, etc. There's a tier list in this forum that rated it D tier which I don't agree with.
Maybe it's my playstyle but I've been finding my hand often depleted because of the cheaper items I like to buy so will definitely be buying this card more.

for a one-time reward，exile almost always offers a bigger potential payoff. But here we are just talking about cards and assistants,which means a lot of repetitive exile.
about exile, your first exile and second exile would make you reap a great harvest. starting with the 3rd exile, it usually doesnt give you any extra benefit any more and even it offers nothing when you dont have any fear or you dont have a powerful enough deck. These are the circumstances that you must experience when you choose a exile-card or exile-assistant. And exile has the ultimate delay, so exile-cards' life is shorter than other cards, they will lose their special value in turn 4 and 5.
In summary, exile is just a very very nomal 1-value resource.
about draw, its value depends on your deck, maybe good or bad. if you have weak deck, DONKEY with 4coins is almost equal to  HAT with 1 coins. you should know something that is DONKEY just offers you one extra card which is usually a coin or a compass rather than an advanced card.
if you have a great deck, DONKEY usually offers you some cheap and numerous advanced cards. because you usually dont have enough coins to buy DONKEY with 4coins and a lot of expensive cards in a same game.
in summary, the value of the draw card is unstable, its ceiling is high but it is very difficult to reach the ceiling.
so draw is a great 1-value resource but it is still a 1-value resource. from drawing assistant，DONKEY ，TURTLE and more cards about draw, you could see that the author has defaulted to draw as 2 resouces it is not reasonable, because some cards like TURTLE offer no extra cards,it means that the value of draw from TURTLE is absolutely 1 !

donkey is too expensive, if 3 coins it will be good.
in lots of time, you should know what the cost is when you gain. For deferred benefits, you need to figure out if it can really be delivered smoothly. The benefits of delay may be huge, but at the same time you have to understand the risks

Maybe we have different thinking systems, I think the resource value of this game is 1, 2 or 3, does not exist 1.5 .  Different resources are applicable to different scenarios, and they can all generate additional resources from their respective applicable scenarios， this is equal for every 1-value resource.
Different resources will have different practical values, but their sources must be equal.

about exile, your first exile and second exile would make you reap a great harvest. starting with the 3rd exile, it usually doesnt give you any extra benefit any more and even it offers nothing when you dont have any fear or you dont have a powerful enough deck.

Sure, items that give exile aren't so good once you have no fear. That's why they pair well when you have or expect excess fear. This can happen when you discover a site in round 1 and take an assistant instead of defeating the guardian, or when playing on the snake temple with its fear gain near the top.

It's not about different thinking systems. You are indeed correct. Those are sound principles with which to analyse the game's economy and choices.

One of these days, when I have time I could do a fan project/variant to "rebalance" these cards.

There's an additional value to cards that draw cards like Ostrich and Turtle. By drawing a card with it, you're more likely to get to play all your cards. If you got rid of your starting fear so all you have is the 4 starting cards, Turtle, and some other card you bought, it's very likely you see all the cards thanks to Turtle (otherwise you'd need to find rewards that gives card draw). If I was able to get Dog or Airplane, then I highly value the +card effects since that makes it more likely that I will get to play my incredible card every round. Plus, playing every card you bought the maximum number of times maximizes the value of those coins/compasses spent buying them.

this is what i want！I'm glad we're on the same page，hahahaha

Except for the first two fear cards. After any fear cards are deleted, the value brought will only be 1 at most
Even in the Snake Temple, exile's value is not magnified and is still only 1.

you say in situations where there are no fear cards in the deck and there are a lot of power cards, Turtle makes it more likely that you will draw all the cards.
If I don't buy the turtle, I can draw the next card too, so why would I pay three coinss for the ship?
in round 1 or 2, You need to build your deck with ture-powerful cards instead of buying turtles . and in round 4 or 5 buying Turtles don't bring you any revenue. The fundamental reason is that the author overestimates the value of the drawing card and sets an unreasonable price for the turtle

I'm surprised that you have the feeling, cards that let you draw (Like Turtle, Donkey and so on) are underpowered.
In all sessions I have played Arnak, these cards are highly contested. And that is because they have several advantages.
Get all your cards everytime
The aim is to get rid of all of you weak starting cards (not just fears). Cards with draw power give you now the opportunity to get your strong value cards every round. Yeah so i can use a revolver 3 times, if I got it in round 2.
Use items on the same round
If you can draw all Cards in a round (your deck is empty), you can buy a new cool item that will help you in a specific situation and draw it immediately.
have control over the Game
If you can draw cards you can have more turns (provided your Cards are actions). More turns means you can wait for actions of your opponents and react. Cool there is a new useful site , I think i take a photo. Ah you are exhausted, okay then i will take a sip of my water bottle and explore another site, now you can use my site you so desperately wanted to visit…not.
Consider that Cards are a ressource too
You Need Cards to use your worker (yeah or coins, i know) or as a ressource for discard costs. That makes turtle really great because turtle says, you don't need to pay a card for exploring (you lose no cards because you draw a new one). And turtle has two ship symbols which means, you have not to pay two cards or 4 coins or 1 card and 2 coins, to visit the cool level 2 site on the top or to visit a site with 1 ship symbol and boot cost for your assistance to get a arrow head.

I got the "Missing expeditions" expansion and I know I'll ruin the spoilers, but I just mixed all the extra cards without going through the campaign.  Can someone help me reset or tell me the cards to put in order by chapter. I know that's a big task to ask.

You can check the Campaign rulebook. It will tell you which item and artififact cards to set aside for each chapter

Except for the new objects and artifacts, the back of the cards indicates which chapter they belong to. So you can sort them chapter per chapter without looking at them - knowing that within a chapter, there is no order.
each chapter will then tell you which new objects and artifacts cards to use. You may get minor spoil looking at them when looking for the one to use, but afaik, nothing too compromising.

There's an airplane symbol (very faint and not easy to see at first) at the bottom of every card in the expansion, so I would start by pulling those out. Then as mentioned you can use the first page for each chapter in the campaign book to check which specific cards go with each chapter - there's no spoilers on the first page for each chapter. You'll still have a number of expansion cards left over, and those are tied to the map objectives. You can just keep those together as a set and search through those when you earn something - just separate them by artifact and item cards and maybe alphabetically and it'll be easy to find them when you need them.
FYI, I just finished the campaign and it took about 10 minutes to go through and reset everything, so it's not very difficult.

Whew! OMG. As we all know, we don't like the feeling that we have may of ruined the experience. Kinda, sorta.

This has already been asked and answered before.
It's all about components of the

expansion.
So the best thing you can do is to search the forum of that expansion.
And then you'll find this thread:

in which you can read what to do.

I was like. Noooooo!!!! What do I do. Thanks for the quickest reply. The set up is the leader deck, achievement rewards, and the encounter deck. I suppose it doesn't matter what order the encounter desk.... right? Please say yes. Lol

No, you'd shuffle the Encounter deck before each play; there are typically two more cards in each Encounter deck than you'll need, to help with replayability.

Can we all agree that this otherwise excellent and well-produced game has one of the cheapest, flimsiest, and inefficient boxes out there? It's pretty much impossible to fit the base game with both expansions (sleeved) in the base box, especially if you've invested in a custom insert. This is one of my favorite games but it's almost impossible to transport without risking box damage or pieces tumbling around. If ever a top tier game needed a collector's box, this was it (see Wingspan, Everdell, Scythe, etc. for inspiration).

So you would rather buy everything a second time for a minor convenience? I am just war too stingy for that. A big box would be nice for new players, but I would definitely not buy it.

Can we all agree that this otherwise excellent and well-produced game has one of the cheapest, flimsiest, and inefficient boxes out there?

No. The box seems pretty normal quality to me. If this is one of the cheapest flimsiest boxes you've encountered, I'm honestly surprised1
Whether it can easily fit all the expansions sleeved is a separate question (which doesn't matter to me personally, not being a sleever nor a completionist...)

I have both expansions sleeved fitted into the base game box, no custom inserts though, all fits snug not tight.
For transport, which I have done quite a few times, I found a good strong box from the supermarket and cut it down so the base box fits without moving, not ideal but it does work, my base box and contents have suffered no damage and I have travelled both private and public.

A good example of what I'm talking about is if you compare this game's box to Scythe. Both are the same length and weight in terms of dimensions, but the Scythe box has additional depth, the cardboard quality is much firmer and the quality of the printing on the box is much better and more durable. Sure, there are probably older/lower budget games that have lower production value, but for a top-rated game that's come out over the past few years, Arnak's box and cardboard component quality is just not up to par with comparable games that retail for a similar price or are meant to hold similar components (Everdell, Dune Imperium, Stonemaier products, Garphill products).

It would be a nice option for new players (like Everdell), or they could do what Stonemaier did with Wingspan and Scythe and just have the collector's box with a nice insert as an option for collectors and completionists. Stonemaier has produced 30,000+ copies of the Wingspan Nesting Box over 3 different printings at this point, so there's definitely a market for this kind of thing out there.

While I wouldn't object to a big box (particularly with at least one more expansion coming), I have no issues with the original box. Curious to see who else chimes in here.
Mostly I'm wondering if your box is from a particular print run, or is possibly an imitation printing? Where did you buy it?

Id' like a big box (empty) designed to fit all the expansions (yes, even the incoming third one) and sleeved cards. Just like AuZtralia Big Box or Viticulture.
They could sell it along with the third expansion.

I have an Etsy insert which holds all the current content but I too would like to see an empty big box available for purchase.  In addition to the Nesting Box and the Scythe Big Box from Stonemeier the folks at R2i who made Canvas recently ran a Kickstarter campaign for this very thing!
Heck, if CGE is worried about funding one on their own dime they could run a Kickstarter or Gamefound campaign... Could even create/include some additional content like promo cards, upgraded tokens, new assistants, or other items if they liked.

As of now I do no think it's necessary. I have both expansions and sleeved cards. Using modified wooden insert, everything fits with a minimal box lift.
But if more expansions are coming, I would pledge and get a big box for myself for sure.

I believe your problem is your insert, not the box. Ditch it and get one that's good for all the expansions. That would be cheaper than buying a Big Box.

Awesome. Can't wait to see what it is.

I don't find the box flimsy or poor quality, but I do find it to be too narrow for the components. The player boards are just a bit too wide, and while I don't have them in the base box anymore, fitting everything else required some tetrissing.
I wish a publisher would use an expansion release to also release a bigger box. The expansion offers various things to the gae, why not a bigger box that is big enough for base + any other expansion.
None of them seem to want to do this, but I wish they would.

Pandemic is the only one to impress me that each expansion and box insert was designed to hold the content released up to that point. Even doing upgrades along the way. Granted there wasn’t a whole lot of stuff to cram into that box so the game and expansions were all in reasonably sized boxes. But it sure was nice to see.

My box survived a car wreck with only 3 blown corners. Hit head one by a driver going 80. It was in a gamenerdz shipping box, so that helped. I did not have other boxes to compare, though.
Real talk, I do find this company's boxes are on the thinner side, but not in a way that I think is a determent.

I have everything for the game and it does fit in the base box, although admittedly barely. I don't sleeve though, I like my games.

It does happen and it's always a bad idea. If you're not a completionist you get a mostly empty box. Looking at you Mystic Vale. It's not as if having a game in two boxes is bad. Hell my descent is in 6 boxes and it's just fine.

For a game like Arnak I want everything that is multiplayer to fit in 1 box as I won't be picking modules.
The solo stuff I keep in the expansion box(unfortunately the blue resource board doesn't fit and is useless unless playing that 1 campaign scenario )

Which one are you using?

I picked up a used copy of the base came and the Leaders exp yesterday and the weight of all of the boards shifting in the box when i angled it to fit it in the floor of my back seat caused one of the corners to blow out. But hey, it's just a box, and I have packing tape

A big box for this would be great!

I've played Arnak close to 300 times now. I recently introduced it 2 new players. To make the game more competitive for all of us and allow them to build up their engines faster than they normally would, 1 person started with the Cat in their hand and the other started with the Dog. So each started with a hand of 6 cards plus the 1 facedown starter card they didn't randomly draw. This early momentum boost gave them a good feeling and kept the game close. I lost in a tiebreaker with final scores of 91/91/89. The next time we played, they each started with an extra 1 coin cost card in their hand instead. That wasn't enough of a boost for them and I ended up winning by 15 points.

https://czechgames.com/en/lost-ruins-of-arnak-the-missing-ex...
you can give them the Prospector and Traveler, from page 10
So they can use the 2 leaders made of cards that are powerful than the base setup

I’ve seen pictures of tablets that have been painted in the creases and it looks sweet. I’ve seen it done with plenty of other minis as well, and it seems like common knowledge for how it’s done, but I have no clue.
What is the process for making them look that way?

This is a picture from BGG as an example of what I’m talking about

That's typically just a thin wash of black ink, which collects in the recesses and dries dark. Once it's dry you can just buff the surfaces with a damp paper towel and they clean right up.
Some people also use a Nulin oil wash, but it takes a bit longer to dry.

Here is a video on how to use Washes for miniature painting that should give you all the details you need.

Thanks so much!

Thank you! Very helpful.

Is this technique something that would have to be reapplied after multiple handlings or would a gloss or matte sealer be viable?

A clear coat isn't a bad idea, but with something like this where the color is in the recesses--which won't be touched--it'll probably keep pretty well on its own.

Good to know. Thanks for the response.

Army Painter Speed Paint, specifically the Pallid Bone colour, would give these a great finish.. Just paint it all over the piece and let it dry.
The speed paint settles in the recesses and runs off the high points giving a pretty respectable finish in one coat (Obv you'd have to clear coat after)

When setting up each scenario in Lost expedition, is it right to set up the rest of the board not mentioned in the scenario specifically as if it is the normal setup?
For example, when playing Tunnels of Terror there is a specific setup for all the sites along the left hand side but nothing for the rest.
So are the sites not mentioned just set up with the standard idol tiles and deal with them as normal sites when playing?

Play the game as normal
except
for any scenario specific setup/rules.

I thought so....thanks.

That's usually the case, but I found it helpful to look at the diagram of the board setup for reference.

This is a question about setup of the game including the

expansion.
Therefore this had to be posted in the forum of that expansion.
I've marked this thread as "Wrong Forum" so an administrator will move it to the proper forum.

I thought that but, in this case, the actual setup diagram doesn't show them (or doesn't appear to). Nor does it reference them.
So that's why I asked.

The picture on page 18/19
DOES
show the idols on other sites, not covered with tunnels.
The rules also specify:

Rulebook, page 18

Advancing Through the Tunnels
Tunnels are discovered sites
, ...

So, since the tunnel sites are discovered, they don't have idols (als normal).
If you are playing solo, then the right column of tunnel sites will not be setup, and those sites get idols as usual (as the other sites).
I don't see anything missing in the setup image on page 18/19.

Similar question for chapter 1 setup. The picture shows no research bonus tiles on the temple research track without explicitly stating that none should be placed. Do I place anyway?

Step 7 of the setup says "The research track does not get any of the usual research bonus tiles." (p. 9)

Can assistants be replaced by new ones once placed on your board?

Can assistants be replaced by new ones once placed on your board?

There are only 2 instances on the research track to gain assistants. How do you want to get more assistants that might replace them?
It's only possible with specific effects like an artifact that explicitly allows to replace one of your assistants with one from the display.

I must have been reading some of the icons from the expansions wrongly because I had several instances where i had some new assistants and no spaces. Probably picking new ones instead of just using the icons on the ones in the display.
My bad! Time to reread the rules......thanks.

I cannot see in any of the rulebook where the term 'activate' is used. However, unless I missed it, I cannot see any definition of what 'activate' actually means. I have therefore had to define it myself and differentiated it from dig.
Dig = pay the cost to move to a site then dig. This includes compasses if discovering a site for the first time.
Activate = take resources from an established site (discovered or pre-printed).
These are normally done as a combined action.
The reason why I am distinguishing between these two actions is that the expansions have cards that refer to a 'free' activation of first level sites or base camp sites. I assume this means an activation without having to travel or dig. But is this right?

Correct!

Yes, activate is to take the resources from a discovered site as if you'd travelled there,
but without any need to actually send a worker (the card will specify exactly which sites you are allowed to choose i.e. tent/level 1/level 2).
It's been a while since I played but isn't there extra player aids in the expansion that explains new icons and terminology?

I cannot see in any of the rulebook where the term 'activate' is used. However, unless I missed it, I cannot see any definition of what 'activate' actually means.

Yes, that's pretty much it. From the back cover of the rulebook, listed alphabetically under "Keywords":

activate a site: When you activate a site, you use the site’s effect. You
do not need an archaeologist there and other players’ archaeologists do
not block you from activating the site, unless the card says otherwise.
You do not pay any travel cost. You cannot activate a site that has not
been discovered yet.

and

activate a site tile: Two cards allow you to activate the top site tile in one
of the stacks. Simply resolve the tile’s effect, as when activating a site.

Thanks - yes I see it now. Nice to see I have been playing it right.

Dig = pay the cost to move to a site then dig. This includes compasses if discovering a site for the first time.

Dig is always a discovered (or pre-printed) site. If it’s a new site, it’s called “discover”. See page 9-10 of the rulebook.

Dig is always a discovered (or pre-printed) site. If it’s a new site, it’s called “discover”. See page 9-10 of the rulebook.

This is the correct terminology.  You can "discover" a new site or "dig" at an already discovered site.
Why would anyone need to unnecessarily create new terms for the game, like "activate," when the game already adequately explains its own terms?

Well, given the designers created the term "activate" (see the rules for

Expedition Leaders

) I guess you'd have to ask them; but given that the term exists in the game, I think it's pretty reasonable to discuss it.

Good point.  I missed where the OP mentioned the expansions.

Maybe I'm missing something in the last couple comments, but (as
Stephen noted upthread
) "activate a site" and "activate a site tile" are explicitly defined in the base game (see Keywords on page 24 of the base game rules), so you don't need an expansion to have the explicit notion of "activate" in Arnak.

You guys are correct.  Please disregard my previous posts, as I clearly don't know what I'm talking about.
The terms "activate," "discover," and "dig" are all explained in the rulebook.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My partner and I have just started playing, and she pointed out something interesting to me that she thought distinguished this game from something like Century Spice Road. It seems you can’t really downgrade things like rubies into tablets or tablets into arrowheads etc. The resource economy seems to have a pretty linear progression from gold to compasses to arrowheads to tablets to rubies.
Is this correct? Are there cards that will let you downgrade/exchange higher quality resources for more common ones in the base game or expansions? We certainly haven’t played the game enough to know ourselves, and at the moment we don’t think of this linear resource exchange as anything like a fault but rather just a quality of Arnak. Probably a feature not a bug.

It's a choice that you have to make when offered an upgrade opportunity.
You can always decline the upgrade (for example, keep an arrowhead to overcome a guardian, rather than have a ruby to advance on the research track), because it is a one way system that doesn't permit downgrades.

If not directly, then indirectly, by buying an artifact using tablets that then rewards you with arrowheads, maybe something like that?
Because it is indirect, and requires spending the resource for a system reward, it incentivizes you to move between the systems in the game (use a worker to get a ruby, spend the ruby to go up a track to get an arrowhead, use the arrowhead to defeat a monster to get a gem, use the gem to go up a track, etc.) instead of twiddling your thumbs converting resources back and forth.
I sometimes find myself with a cache of unused resources at the end, and I feel that is a failure of me to optimize my path through the systems. If I could just convert those unused tablets to arrowheads it would be less of a puzzle to solve.

This is a productive way to frame our thinking!

As said earlier, it is a one way trade: only upgrades are possible, but not mandatory.
There are no cards or actions in base game and expansions that let you downgrade a resource (ruby to arrowhead, or arrowhead to tablet).

There are no cards or actions in base game and expansions that let you downgrade a resource (ruby to arrowhead, or arrowhead to tablet).

There is actually one artifact card (One-eyed statue) in the Expedition leaders expansion that lets you exchange a ruby for two tablets and two arrowheads.

"Exchange" isn't "downgrade" though, you're still getting more from less.

"Exchange" isn't "downgrade" though, you're still getting more from less.

Correct, and the OP asked if there were any cards that downgrade/
exchange
, which there are.

That's fair.
Though, one card that might not put in an appearance (especially as it's from an expansion) is not going to presently satisfy the OP's quest.

Note, an arrowhead is worth more than a tablet. So tablet to arrowhead is an upgrade, not a downgrade, and can be done with any upgrade action. The only upgrade options are tab -> arrow or arrow -> jewel.
Downgrading is rare, and only possible via certain artifacts as mentioned upthread.

Mín and I have some new concepts for Arnak that we are currently exploring. We are in an early phase of prototyping (don’t hold your breath for any kind of announcement any time soon), but since CGE uses a wonderful prototyping system we thought it would be fun to give it a try and to invite some of you to join our testing!
It will run for only a couple of weeks, and we aim to see if this kind of content is something that Arnak players would enjoy. The content is quite approachable, so even if you don’t have plenty of experience with previous expansions, you should have no problem joining the testing.
If this sounds like fun to you, please fill out
this sign-up form
and Mucube (our community manager) will select some of you and help you get started.
Thank you for your interest!
EDIT:
(15 May 2024)
Playtesting for the new Arnak material has now finished. I would like to thank everyone who took the time to apply to playtest with us. We received a TON of submissions, and it is heartwarming to know how many of you remain passionate about Arnak.
There will likely be another opportunity to playtest Arnak with us sometime later this year. If you would like to be notified, you may still complete the sign-up form in the opening post if you haven’t already, and we will send you an email when the time comes. (You can also indicate whether you are specifically interested in testing Arnak Solo content). Thank you all for helping make this playtest successful!

Love the game, and think it's cool you're continuing content!

Will definitely share this link with my Arnak regulars <3

Thank you, Nathan! We only want to add new content if we see that it really adds value to the player. I don't think we'll be adding new expansions for too long, as we feel that Arnak with its expansions is already close to how we envisioned it.

Will definitely share this link with my Arnak regulars <3

Thanks, Vichi! :-)

You can always make another game in the same world
The setting itself is just too cool!

This is what I would hope for:  Another game, with different mechanics, that gives us more of the lore and perhaps focuses more on the details of the temples and sites that we see in Arnak.  Every time I discover a new site, my imagination runs wild based on the artwork of the new site tile.

If there is anything solo specific for it to test then sign me up, love to play solo.

this is excellent! more Arnak more fun! maybe this expansion would come with a glorious big box!

If there is anything solo specific for it to test then sign me up, love to play solo.

Hi Matt! Try to click through the sign-up form. There is already an option to sign up for the solo testing wave that will start later.
Just indicate in the comments that you are only interested in solo testing. Thanks!

I signed up for solo  but wanted to make an early plea for some kind of big box storage along the lines of Scythe and Wingspan.

Very excited about this! My wife and I played through the story campaign and really enjoyed it!

I'd love to play test a large box and insert for everything.

I signed up as soon as I saw this, Arnak is one of my favourite games and I'd love the opportunity to help play test new stuff

This is incredibly exciting news for our group. Arnak already takes up so much of our time and more content is always loved and appreciated. Looking forward to more.
Also worth mentioning that I agree with Mate Sasdi’s point below. Cheers guys

Thank you, Nathan! We only want to add new content if we see that it really adds value to the player. I don't think we'll be adding new expansions for too long, as we feel that Arnak with its expansions is already close to how we envisioned it.

Nooo! We need another campaign
My suggestion is: please consider a BIG BOX where we could store the game + all the three expansion (designed for sleeved cards!).
Please!

Yes a bigger box and some deluxe components ?

If the game is close to complete in your eyes with the current expansion, what additional content do you guys plan on releasing?

We'll be sure to announce it as soon as we're ready!

Hi! Thanks for this amazing games!
We supposed to get this game still in 2024 or is a 2025 expansion?
Will there be any news at any con?
Thanks @Elwen!

Hi!
2024 is too early, but if the work goes well, we might share some more information before the Essen Spiel.

I hope there will be a big box with the new expansion.

A bigbox will be nice, the base box is full as hell

Would be nice if you could make something like the Viticulture Wine Crate. a new expansion wich you can buy in a nice big box with an insert for all previous stuff


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got this game a while back as a gift and have been playing non-stop.
Not sure how often the designers frequent the BGG page, but I just wanted to say how amazing of a game it is and productions values are great.
I hope they are not done with making content for this game. I, for one, will continue supporting this game.

There are already 2 published expansions:

(adding asymmetric player powers and more) and

(2 more leaders and a 6 chapter campaign, solo or 2 player co-op).
The campaign is a revised and improved campaign based on the PnP

, which can be downloaded from
arnak.game
. There you also can find a web based app to play this 4 chapter (solo) campaign.
The designers have said in an interview that they think of new content (i.e. a new expansion), but there was no other information given.

Don't forget, there are tons of fan made solo stuff under files as well as other fane made stuff. Plenty play time I would say.

Hello again fellow gamers,
I just scored 61 points on BGA last night but only 59 just now and came up one resource short of reaching the top of the Bird Temple as well just now.  It didn't help that I was up against a Strong player with ELO of 384.  He managed to buy both Gold AND Bronze bonus tiles!  And he had FIVE Fear cards but I exiled all of mine!  I am thinking of giving up this game and playing Obsession instead to enjoy worker placement and deck building together.  28 games but only 5 victories.  I cannot get resources enough to research like I once was able to do.  Once I did manage to buy a Gold bonus tile, so it is possible, I know.
Only two meeples and not much draw power in this game has me not enjoying it much.  This seems to be a game that just doesn't fit well with my strengths at the hobby.  Can anyone advise me before I do stop playing this game?  I have stopped other games on BGA already.

If you aren't enjoying it and don't feel it plays to your strengths, absolutely stop playing it. There are too many great games out there to explore and there's nothing wrong with not liking a particular one, even if others love it.
Personally, I love Arnak, but I like games where you are managing randomness and games that escalate from "geez I'm getting nothing done" to " holy smokes, the last turn is crazy", and I love the theme. I focus on trying to figure out the best way to keep moving up the track while also taking every action I can in a turn, even if the benefit is risky. And I win pretty often, although I'm not playing against the entire internet like on BGA.
The end of the day, why are we gaming if it's not fun?

There are many good interesting strategy articles here in the strategy forum if you want strategy advice.
You could also try simply playing with people who are more at your own strength level instead of much stronger players (who of course are probably going to win).
But if you think that the fundamental problem is not merely that you're losing often, but that you simply do not enjoy the game, then I'd agree with Denise that there's no point continuing to play the game if you simply don't enjoy the game.

It's fine on BGA, but I do think the game is more fun (win or lose) with the expansions. I'm playing through the leaders solo and then I'll try the campaign solo. While I really enjoy Arnak I don't love playing Arena on BGA as well. I'm just nowhere near as good as the experienced players on there, and that's fine. Still a fun game IMO.

I think Denise said it best: "The end of the day, why are we gaming if it's not fun?"
There are lots of games I've stopped playing simply because I don't enjoy them. For example, Agricola is a much-loved game that so many people enjoy playing, but I hate the huge card draw at the beginning and the very tight gameplay that follows. So I don't play it anymore.
If you love worker placement and deckbuilding, and you want either of those things to be the center of your experience, then Arnak probably isn't going to appeal to you very much. It contains those elements but they are mixed in with a lot of other stuff...they are relatively small parts of the game as a whole.
Russ also said it well: if you are playing with more experienced players then that's also going to turn you off.
I'd put Arnak aside and try something else!

61 is a beginner score that shows that your game didn't fly at all.
But you have to know: With Arnak, there is a very fine line between a bad and a great game. Only a few resources at the beginning of the game make the difference.
My recommendation for the bird temple:
1. do not waste a single resource
2. buy 2-3 good cards in round 1 or 2 (those that give you 3 resources! or that give you a lot of flexibility - e.g. dog, binocular, pickaxe, balloon, airplane, chronometer, brush, ...)
3. avoid discovery in Rounds 1-2 (1-3). Do discover in round 4 + 5 (at least one level 1 and one level 2 site)
4. use compasses to buy artefacts in Round 2+3 that let you advance in the temple!  (anything that gives you arrowheads or rubies ...)
5. push advancing in the temple as much as you can
6. as the book gives much higher bonus than the magnifying glass -> The book should always be directly next to the magnifying glass
7. get second helper in round 2 at the latest. get second helper upgraded in round 3 (or 4)!
With this a good score in the middle of 70s up to 80 should be feasible,

Play the physical game with

, which includes The Captain, who has 3 Meeple archaeologists…

Hello again fellow gamers,

One thing I see newer/beginner players do a lot is constantly visit the 2-compass tent site in order to afford discovering a site. This is inefficient and risky. Make it a priority to get compasses passively (either via item cards, or progressing on the bird temple), and use those to discover sites (hopefully with your first worker, as you can then react to what you discover with your 2nd).
Also, always try to discover a site when you're in line to be first player the FOLLOWING round. This means you can discover, AND visit the site again on the next round. This also gives you the flexibility to not defeat your guardian if you want the resources gained for something else, as no one will steal it from you.

My recommendation for the bird temple:
3. avoid discovery in Rounds 1-2 (1-3). Do discover in round 4 + 5 (at least one level 1 and one level 2 site)
4. use compasses to buy artefacts in Round 2+3 that let you advance in the temple!  (anything that gives you arrowheads or rubies ...)
5. push advancing in the temple as much as you can

I don't agree with some of this. Guardians are the best source of points, and idols are also valuable, so discovering often is important. Contrary to much opinion, the research track is not as good, prioritizing that too high is a mistake. If you are efficient with resources (in agreement with your point 1) then you can catch up with the glass and book later.
And to the OP, buying temple tiles is often bad, you should not be making that a goal.

Guardians are the best source of points -> But Guardians are dead points. They need a lot of resources and don't push your game. They are just dead VPs.
Yes idols are very nice - but too much discovering can easily kill your game.
Of course for are real good strategy you'll combine discovering and temple research more. But my list are just hints for beginners to break the 70 VP barrier.

Minor quibble here but Obsession isn't  really a deck builder at all. You have literally no choice as to what cards get added, and it's actually a hand from which you select cards, so there's no deck per se.
As for quitting a game because you're bad at it, that's entirely your prerogative. Some people like the challenge, some people don't mind losing, it's different for everyone. If you're not enjoying the experience, you shouldn't feel compelled by anyone else to keep playing.
P.S. 28 games with 5 victories isn't bad at all.

It's also not really a worker placement game either. While you are technically placing workers, it's in your own personal space rather than a common area, which is typically a defining characteristic of worker placement games.

Personally, I like losing. It tells me that a game offers a lot to learn.
But if the flavor of this one doesn't resonate, have you considered Mage Knight or other crunchier games?

I do enjoy that aspect of Obsession, though, since players are not competing with each other for spots.  Wayfarers of the South Tigris is the same with dice: each player has a board and puts cards alongside it.  Also, increasing reputation in Obsession is much easier for me than going up the track in Arnak.  You also get points for Objectives in Obsession and for those building tiles.  You do get points on your board and for idols in Arnak, but not as many.

No, I have not.  Never even heard of Mage Knight.  Theme is a big deal to me; I enjoy city building, historical stuff, and economic themes such as resource management and trade and buying stuff.  Crunchier games I know are A Feast for Odin, Merv, and Praga Caput Regni.

Too many great games out there to waste time on one you don't really enjoy. I love Arnak and would never say no to playing it, but it's not going to be for everyone - and that's not a comment about you or anyone else, we all just have different tastes.
That said, I'm terrible at the game too, lol. My wife and oldest child regularly beat me. But I always have fun playing it, so I want to keep playing it.
This hobby should be - first and foremost - fun.

If you like theme I'd recommend Mage Knight too. But it's definetly heavier than A Feast for Odin, Merv and Praga. That said, there are great "how to play" videos out there if reading Vlaada's rule books isn't for you (it isn't for me).

Personally, I like losing. It tells me that a game offers a lot to learn.
But if the flavor of this one doesn't resonate, have you considered Mage Knight or other crunchier games?

The test for me is always "did I have fun". I would say I'd rather lose regularly than win regularly, probably for the same reason you do.

I agree. I’ve been a gamer all my life , starting with  snakes and ladders and snap, and moving in through SPI games, Advanced Squad Leader, and into the recent crop; Scythe, Race for the Galaxy, Wingspan, and Twilight Inscription. Approaching my seventh decade as a gamer, I’ve had to be quite harsh with myself over how many games do I really ever want to play again… good as they may have been in my yoof and middle-age. Anything with a myriad of rules is out, so it is games like Arnak that still deliver for me.
Sadly, as an ex-public employee, I keep records of outcomes of my games, with (my) comments. I do occasionally learn from my mistakes, but other times, I blame bad luck or approaching senility! As Shakespeare said…. The game’s the thing!

You could also try simply playing with people who are more at your own strength level instead of much stronger players (who of course are probably going to win).

Yep - this option is your friend on BGA

Bga is very competitive and you can't enjoy the game with bga players until you have enough strength.
In the early days of playing anark on bga, I would regard all the opponents I met as extremely strong opponents, i don't know the contents of the cards, I don't know which relics exist and which don't, I don't know what each resource is used for and I only have a score of 54.  But I also know that I came to bga just for learning, and I just want to become a master so that I can experience more advanced happiness than cheap happiness.
and now, my elo is 548. I've encountered a lot of bandit players rather than true explorers, who join the game and loot all sorts of treasures without defeating the guardians without delving into the tracks and just taking the valuable treasures they see and deservedly lost the game . i was so angry that I chewed my teeth sometimes their predation would deprive me of a real title contender.  Although this time is not happy or even a little painful, but this emotion is also meaningful, I still don't deliberately reject pain.
Don't let happiness come too easy, it's something we can experience but not something we pursue.

Good recommendations here.  A couple more hints:
1.  The best Archs are Spear makers, gold guy, compass girl. Parchment and travel/compass are next.
2. The best artifacts are Star charts, guiding skull, stone key, Guardian Ocarina.
3.  Plan your turns out... you know how many idols you have to use and how many resources you can create.  You can easily calculate how many gold, compass, etc you will have.  The only variable is unexplored sites, card draws, and weather you win a race to a certain site.  Then make sure you win the races you need to win to get to where you want to end up for the turn.
I can't stress enough how unimportant exploring is in the early game.  Play a few games where you refuse to explore until turn 3.  Take the variability out of the equation and see if you can "figure" out the game.

This first point is the most important step from moving your average score from the 60's to the 80's.

Buying temple tiles is bad?  What in the world do you mean by that?
High level players (I oscillate around 500 on BGA) usually score between 85-100 on the bird side.  The path to 100 is both researchers to the top of the temple, 4 guardian kills, 1-2 slots still open on the idol track and an 11 point tile.  You absolutely should be trying to get those to close out the game.

The

Advanced Gameplay Reviews series

analyzes gameplay and strategy. Rules and components are explained on the go.

Lost Ruins of Arnak
(LRoA) is a resource conversion euro where players explore an uncharted island. They discover new sites, overcome their guardians (yes, up to this point it almost sounds like a reversal of

, itself a reversal of a euro trope), and research clues in order to find the “lost temple”. Yeah alright, it’s just to score VPs.
Note: this review will also cover the expansions

(EL) and

(ME).

Parsing the board. Prescribed play

Unlike the impenetrable boards of many expert-level euros, the general outline of play is pretty clear from the board layout.



The worker placement section is the main purveyor of resources. You can
send one of your 2 workers on site
to
fetch resources
. The resources can be kept on your personal board,
buy cards in the Market or pay for costs on the Research Track
. The Research Track is essentially an elaborate scoring track on which it costs resources to move up.

The prescribed progression is visual: just go up the board. It’s true of both the worker placement and the Research Track, making it easy to teach and understand the game.



The players try to send workers to
increasingly higher-level
sites,
from basic to Level I to Level II
. The costs increase (basically doubling between Level I and Level II), but so do the rewards. On the right side, they try to
climb up the Research Track
, netting them VPs and various rewards on the way, including resources to feed back into the resource-to-VP loop.

The players help the upward progression along by deckbuilding. The game is basically an efficiency race in 5 rounds.



The cards on top form the starting deck. The card below is an upgrade that
produces 2 Compasses
, twice more than the equivalent starting card. When buying cards, it is easy to overlook the Travel icons that can
pay for the cost of dispatching a worker
(as an alternative to the effect in the text box). They’re even more valuable if you play the Journalist (ME), who may pay a Site’s Travel cost a second time to retrieve an
Article token placed there during setup
. That token can be traded for an effect listed on his special board. Note that the Fear cards that hinder the starting deck also
sport a Travel icon
good enough to travel to a basic site. The Mystic (EL) even adds one to his hand each round to help fuel his special abilities. As a free card that extends the 5-card limit, it’s actually a great “resource” to dump for actions that require discarding a card from hand as a cost. Discarding doesn’t remove the card from the deck (the discard is added back to the deck at the end of the round), but the Mystic’s starting cards can “exile” cards from his deck effortlessly.

There’s some subtle hand-holding keeping the players from going wildly off rails.



The Scepter doesn’t just
slide
to mark the current round, it also separates the card Market into 2 tiers. On its left are the
Artefacts
(blue cards) that
cost Compasses
, and on its right the
Items
that
cost Coins
. So as the game goes on, there will be more Artefacts and fewer Items. Both card types behave differently upon purchase. Purchased Items are placed on the bottom of the deck, to be drawn probably next round or later, depending on the current deck size. You’ll very rarely be able to play an Item on the turn you purchase it, for example through
effects that draw from the bottom of the deck
. Purchased Artefacts trigger immediately. This difference will be key when we mention the protracted late rounds.

The Market tiers correspond to a resource hierarchy.



The Items typically produce
basic resources
(Compasses and Coins, sometimes Tablets), or
convert them
. Artefacts, on the other hand, can produce higher-level resources directly. Unlike a

, where resource conversion works fluidly forward and back, conversion in LRoA is one-way, as iconized by the most common
conversion effect
(Tablet to blue Arrowhead, or blue Arrowhead to red Jewel). Exceptionally, one card in EL can
convert a Jewel to lower-level resources
.

It’s pretty clear that Items are meant to be purchased early in the game to slowly build up from basic resources. The Artefacts are less interesting early on for the following reasons:
• the limited Market
• they cost 1 Tablet resource to play from hand (so only their first use is free)
• they all only have one Travel icon, so not too useful to travel to Level II Sites
• they cost Compasses, which would be better spent toward discovering new Sites
Interestingly, 2 Leaders from EL somewhat blur the clean dichotomy between Items and Artefacts. The Professor has a private Artefact Market all for himself, so he doesn’t suffer from the limited availability of Artefacts early on. On the other hand, the Baroness can treat Items like Artefacts: once per round, she can buy one Item and put it directly into her hand. The utility of her power decreases with the dwindling Item market, though.
In light of the previous considerations, the strategic plan for the players looks like this:



A successful strategy emerges from the harmonious progression along 3 axes: Site Discovery, Market buy strategy, and Research Track. Note that we’ll talk about the Assistants later.

To sum up, the strategic plan is globally prescribed by the constraints and potential payoffs. What is left to the players to figure out is how to bring player contention and random parameters (Market, Sites and Guardians) into the plan.

The round-milking

The explorer theme comes through when discovering a new Site, which is appropriate, since discovering Sites has the best down-the-road payoff of all the actions in the game.



When discovering a new Site, the uncertainty comes from the random Site tile and its random Guardian.
The tile rewards can more or less match the Guardian’s cost.

What makes Site Discovery truly profitable and worth the uncertainty is the Idol(s) you gain. Besides their non-negligible VP value,
the Idols give the players the ultimate flexibility to improvise and exercise some control over the randomness
.



The Idols are a form of one-time workers. Their owner can
place an Idol on an empty “Idol space” on their personal board
, and choose one of the listed rewards at the cost of
forfeiting the VPs associated with the Idol space
. Here, this allows the player to get
the Compass and Coin they were missing to defeat a Guardian
.

A mistake players can make is leave a Guardian alone and use the resources to race up the Research Track instead. Besides the 6-VP swing (more if another player grabs the Guardian), assets like Guardians, Idols and Assistants are a significant source of action advantage down the line. Since you keep them from round to round, they can be seen as an extension of your hand of cards to start a round. Additionally, there are effects to refresh them for repeated use (in particular, the Assistants do so automatically at the end of the round).
Scoring roughly correlates to the number of actions
, so milking/dragging the round is actually a kind of unspoken objective. Late in the game, the greater resource outputs per action as well as the switch from buying Items to buying Artefacts (which have an immediate effect on the current round) are big reasons for the protracted AP-prone rounds. You’ll even buy Items you can’t use, because the cards themselves are worth VPs. As the number of possibilities/actions explodes, the gameplay evokes the virtuosity of a

, though without the depth of specialization (to come even remotely close, LRoA would have to at least feature multiple Research Tracks).
The one factor that keeps the round-milking honest is player contention
.



The green player has 3 Compasses and 2 Tablets stored on his player board. They could now
move their “Notebook” Research Token up one row (1)
by paying the listed cost (1 Compass and 2 Tablets). As a reward, they would be allowed to
pick one of 3 Assistants (2)
. But they spot an opportunity in the Artefact Market: they instead buy the Sandals,
costing them their 3 Compasses
, to activate any basic Site with one of their already dispatched workers. They choose to
transfer a worker to the Compass Site to regain 2 Compasses
, so they can still move their Notebook on their next turn. It’s a 3-for-2 trade, but the Artefact itself is worth 1 VP and will give them a lot of flexibility in future rounds.
There’s a tempo cost to the maneuver though
. Since buying the Artefact counted as the action for the turn, another player (not depicted) may be able to grab the coveted Assistant before the green player’s next turn.

This opportunity/efficiency tradeoff exists even in the solo game.

The effectively beat-your-own-score solo game

The solo mode has you compete against a bot opponent.
Unlike the “Automas” of games like

or

, there is no credibility to the bot score as an absolute metric, since its performance varies based on the random Market and whether it can grab a Guardian or 2 on the way. Its Research token will almost always reach the top of the Research Track. In the aforementioned games, the bot score scales based on the scoring objectives randomly assigned during setup, so there’s at least some degree of transparency to how the target score is calculated. In LRoA, you can beat the bot so bad that any illusion of meaning it could have had quickly dissipates.
Arguably,
its true purpose is to simulate player interaction
. For example, what matters more than the fact that it reaches the top of the Research Track is which bonus tiles or Assistants it’ll take away before you can.
The bot cycles through the same set of 10 actions each round. The only uncertainty is the order it performs these actions. Among these actions, the bot can place workers that will block yours, take cards from the Market, or move up the Research Track. In effect, they keep the solo player from optimizing their turns in a vacuum, as they must weigh the risk that the bot may disrupt their plan. ME develops that central concept further, arguably in more thematic and challenging ways.

The tight balance and replayability of the solo/coop campaign of The Missing Expedition

The round-milking is a fluid process that can be enjoyed for itself even in the solo game. But
it is ultimately limited by the same general railroading and the one-sided objective of milking the rounds for VPs
.
The solo/coop campaign of
The Missing Expedition
doesn’t exactly lift that limitation, but refocuses it through win/loss conditions. It also baits the players into fulfilling optional sub-objectives (sidequests if you will) with fixed card rewards as well as ramifications for the campaign (boon cards to start the next chapter, and end story).
One can tell from the legacy-like custom setups that the designers are no strangers to euro designs. This was already apparent in the base game, but even more so in ME. Each chapter (playable as a one-off), the main board becomes their playground (exploiting for example the fact that the Sites AND the Market form a grid), giving a different look and focus to various parts of the core game.
•
Chapter 1
introduces the Encounter cards (more on them later) as a reward for discovering new Sites. It sets up a kind of boss battle against a Guardian
on the Research Track
.
•
Chapter 2
is a race to the top of the Research Track in only 4 rounds. It treats the Site grid as a form of fixed market à la

(when you discover a new Site, you gain the associated card placed there faceup during setup), giving the players more options besides the Market. The hard mode for this Chapter isn’t a mere dial-up: it changes the new market from an Item market to an Artefact market.
•
Chapter 3
introduces neat mini-puzzles of defeating groups of Guardians (in hard mode, one has
6
of them).
•
Chapter 4
simulates a rising tide that forces progression up the Research Track. It also has an “escort mission”, if anything in a resource euro can be called that.
• In
Chapter 5
, you must slow down a convoy moving across the Site grid by timing and targeting differently your Market purchases.
•
Chapter 6
combines the Guardian mini-puzzles with checkpoints along a custom Research Track.



Defeating a group of Guardians gives the resource conversion puzzle another look. Here the player could defeat the Crab first to
produce Tablets
required to overcome the Owl. Defeating the Ape as well would allow to
convert one of the Tablets to an Arrowhead
which,
combined with Travel icon of the defeated Owl
, would allow to shoot down the Eagle (by the way, the thematic touch on the Guardian costs is quite apparent here, though it’s a detail I only caught during the writing of this review).





Mixing expansions multiplies the tactical possibilities. In one of my games, I was able to buy the Artefact Divine Riders (EL), which allows to
treat each Guardian boon as a conversion effect
. It was rather fortunate in a game where
I was stuck with many Tablets
but needed Arrowheads. Interestingly, Divine Riders scales up significantly if you collected a lot of Guardians as a result of fulfilling Chapter requirements, magnitudes more than in a normal game.

The base game (solo and multiplayer) was all about scoring VPs, but here you might not have enough time and resources for that or even “playing the right way” (e.g., investing into a solid deck, defeating a Guardian after discovering a new Site, and so on). The campaign brings a sensation unknown to the base solo game: fulfilling a
mandatory
objective in the nick of time. And another one: losing. This takes care of one of my pet peeves, namely solo/coop games that I win comfortably right away.
The scoring is still there, though secondary
. But this time, it would be disingenuous of me to downplay the target score, because the highest score to beat is 100, and I finished my first campaign (normal mode) at 101, and my second (hard mode) at 105. The guess here is that they balanced the thing right. They even had the scoring tiers multiply the endings of 3 potential “story paths”, for a total of 9 endings. If this is not a labor of love, I don’t know what is.



When a player gains an Encounter card, they must choose one of 2 rewards:
the left one takes effect immediately
,
the right one can be triggered later as an action
. Either way, the choice advances you on a “narrative path” on a campaign sheet. When you reach a star node along a narrative path, you get to add a specific bonus card to your starting deck for the next Chapter. At the end of the campaign, your advancements across all the narrative paths will be compounded to determine the “story path” you’re on.

This implies replayability: you can approach the Encounters either with tactical optimization in mind, or thematically, in which case you might have to take on the challenge of getting the most out of an inadequate reward.
That you can replay the campaign with different Leaders from EL wasn’t technically necessary (but we’re grateful nonetheless). The campaign alone, along with the 2 abnormally customizable Leaders it ships with, completely saves the base game for solo players in search for carefully tuned thematic challenges.

Thank you for your insight. It seems I have to give this game another try. I abandoned it after two or three plays when it first hit the market but these two expansions seem like they would make this game worth it for me.

I would only recommend you give it another try if you were displeased specifically with the BYOS aspect of the solo mode. If you didn't like the core system, chances are that the expansions won't change your mind. I might be wrong though.

Sorry to be pedantic, second image caption, “ climb up the Research Track” should be red text?
And later “ The tile rewards can more or less match the Guardian’s cost.” blue?

Superb analysis, thanks as always
I’ve only played this multiplayer, and without any of the expansions. What .i love about it is that there’s a comfortable decision space in just “should I move up the left side or the right”, that (unlike so many other games) has never left me wanting to complicate it further. That and the “this leads to this leads to this” card play is plenty of decision space for me, so it sounds like Gaia Project would be too much

Yes, that’s kind of its niche, a much simpler Gaia Project. I’m glad you could get a sense of GP’s complexity. That means others interested in LRoA, but who played GP, could get a sense of LRoA’s complexity. Thanks as usual for the feedback!

This is great! I'm a big fan of this game and know it well but really liked being reading your very clear birds-eye-view explanation of the systems. I'm interested to read more from you, thanks!

You’re welcome! I didn’t check how the experts play the game, so it’s cool to know whether some of them don’t totally refute my analysis lol

Interesting post. I couldn’t get my head round Gaia Project… at 69 I just found it hard work! This game is much better… it’s not the rules that are difficult (they’re not!) it’s just the choices open to you, and the combos you might be able get, and trying to keep in how you are doing against other players. The one danger is, with only five rounds and no random die rolls…. Analysis Paralysis.
However naval~gazing is not my bag of Liptons,  so I’m happy to make a wrong turn here and there to keep the flow of the gaming. I tend to play most of my board games digitally these days- `Roll for the Galaxy, Scythe, Game of Thrones, Dune Imperium…etc. But with my added bling for the counters, and the thick card stock, this is one that pleases the mind and the digits!

When I advance on the research track and gain a bonus tile to upgrade a resource:
1. Can I choose not to upgrade? I assume I can, since you can forgo most beneficial effects If I remember correctly.
2. If my assumption on the first question was right and I decide not to use the bonus tile, is it still taken away? Do I have the option to leave it be and later advance to the same space with my notebook to use the effect?

Bonus tiles must be used immediately or they are lost. Just like face-up idol powers.

Correct, beneficial effects are optional.

2. If my assumption on the first question was right and I decide not to use the bonus tile, is it still taken away? Do I have the option to leave it be and later advance to the same space with my notebook to use the effect?

You take the tile whether you use it or not. This is very explicitly clear; see step 4 on page 14.

The Journal lets you exile the card to advance on the research track with your notebook for free. Just to confirm, can this be used to on the Snake Temple to advance the notebook without having to discard an idol on the halfway point?

I guess so. It says for free, and the snake part of the rules says pay 1 idol, so to my mind that means no payment required.

New to the game, playing exclusively 2 player. We played 12 times in our first week. We haven't tried the 'rescue' side of the board yet.
What's the best expansion for two players only?

I'd say go for Expedition Leaders as you'll get more variety in the asymmetry of the leaders, plus new artifacts, new items, new site, new guardians, new temple tracks.
But then get The Missing Expedition too.

If you're interested in a cooperative experience, The Missing Expedition includes a 1-2P coop campaign.

The Missing Expedition

, flips the game on its head and makes it a six chapter, co-operative campaign.
When the campaign is over you will have added all of the new content to the base game.  Or, if co-op isn't your thing, then just add the new content to the game, but then you may as well go with

Expedition Leaders

as your first expansion.

All the expansions are good because they add new research tracks.  That's my favorite part.  My wife and I essentially play a different research track each time we play.  We also alternate playing with Leaders and playing without Leaders.
I've never played the campaign and we have zero interest in that.  Also, I didn't add the new sites from the 2nd expansion because I didn't like adding the "story" elements via the encounter cards.

Expedition Leaders

is great for any player count simply because it adds asymmetric leaders which can change up gameplay quite a lot. The additional research tracks are nice to have, too.

The Missing Expedition

includes two more leaders (one with a monkey assistant, c'mon) and another research track, but it's primarily centered around a six-game, 1-2p co-op campaign. Note that's campaign, not legacy, so you don't trash anything and can play it more than once if you choose.
Not sure what's best for 2p; they're both pretty solid. I would, however, definitely suggest them in that order. Knowing how to use the different leaders and being able to switch around during the campaign really enhanced the experience.

No doubt here: Start with the first expansion,

Played the game at a convention, thoroughly enjoyed it, purchased it afterwards. Punching out all the cardboard today was a horrible experience. One player board ripped because there wasn't enough 'tags' on one side. 3-4 rips on locations. I just opened it and the game already looks used. The worst punchout boards I've seen, didn't matter how careful I was with it. Terrible first experience owning it.

Curious, I don’t remember having any problem with mine.

No, Brass Birmingham takes the cake for that one.  I've had some bad punch boards, but Brass was an absolute nightmare.  I still wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats sometimes thinking about it.

Same.

No issues with my copy. I'd reach out to the publisher.

Hmm maybe I should shoot them a message as well. The rip gives away what the monster is going to be so there is gameplay elements that are ruined.

CGE has the best customer service in my book. Make photos and ask for a replacement. I am sure they will send you one.
Also, if you have problems like this, always have a knife on hand to cut stuff like this and prevent tears.

This was exactly the issue that I addressed when I contacted CGE and they were very understanding.

Contact CGE via their
Replacements
web page.
You'll be asked for the game's serial number, which you can find ink-sprayed on an inside wall of the box bottom.
(I had no issues with my punchboards.)

Unless the forums are drowning in negative posts about a game it is mostly just a copy issue. It’s mass production and they do not check everything. The cutters could have been worn out or wrongly setup. It’s all part of business that x % of products are of less quality or faulty and get replaced if you just tell them.
So it’s neither this game nor Brass.

I noticed this, too. I had to use glue to repair 5 tiles. But I'm happy with the quality of everything else.

Though I've been playing this game a lot, and searching the forums for this very specific questions, I have yet to have this question answered for sure.
Can you take a free action exactly when you want during your turn, even in the middle of a card resolving?
For example, I play the Ostrich (Draw a card, place a worker with a discount of Car) and have no other cards in my hand, and 2 compasses. I draw a compass card. Can I now play this card as a free action, and then resume to resolve the rest of the card and thus explore a site I since I now have 3 compasses?
Normally, this doesn't matter since I could play the card before or after. And if I use the card as a travel symbol, it's crystal clear that I can do that since discarding it for travel symbol is part of the latter effect. But playing a free action whilst "in the middle of a resolvement", is that okay?
(During our gameplay, we made a judgement call and said it was okay, but the player ignored the possibility anyway, and the situation wasn't for compasses, but a coin to pay for a snack token he needed to move his worker, and unlike the travel symbol which is payed for with the card itself, this actually requires you to first play the coin card to receive it and then pay for it.)

Though I've been playing this game a lot, and searching the forums for this very specific questions, I have yet to have this question answered for sure.
Can you take a free action exactly when you want during your turn, even in the middle of a card resolving?

Yes. It's discussed in past threads (do a forum search for
free action before during after
), and also explicitly stated in the rulebook (bottom of page 8): "before, after and even during your main action."

We read that part of the rulebook but didn't think it sufficed. But now that I'm thinking about it, what else could "during your main action" mean, so I guess you are correct.

No need to guess, Russ has pointed you to the rulebook where it answers your question explicitly.
For example, if you discover a new site as your main action, and the site has a resource upgrade, you could use an idol free action to obtain a tablet, then upgrade it using the newly discovered site.

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3253036/article/43844064#43...

I thank you for your answer, but I respectfully disagree that this post is an example of what I described here in the thread. He does refer to the rulebook, but I was looking for an example that reminded me of my situation, and his example was to use a free action Before using his main action to discover a site. Not arguing what is right or wrong here, but to explain the situation, my confusion in the first place arose since many games allow you to use "instant" effects, but you still need to resolve any effect completely before moving on to the next.
Like in Magic: The Gathering, you can use instant effects almost whenever you like, but if a card says "Deal 1 damage. Draw a card." you are not allowed to do anything between those effects since you must resolve a card in its entirety first.
We also thought this wasn't possible on BGA, but since these are the rules, I assume it is, which also would confirm it.

I'm confused now as to what your confusion is about. Just because Magic the Gathering doesn't let you do something doesn't mean that Arnak must work the same way. Earlier upthread, you seemed to agree that "during" indeed means "during":

We read that part of the rulebook but didn't think it sufficed. But now that I'm thinking about it, what else could "during your main action" mean, so I guess you are correct.

Have you changed your mind on that, and you again no longer think that the rule's wording "before, after or even during your main action" means that you can do a free action in the middle of doing your main action?
What do you think "even during your main action" means, if it doesn't mean that you can do it in the middle of doing your main action?

It seems you are not understanding one bit what I meant with my post, so I will rephrase it for you:
Thanks a lot for your answer and effort, I appreciate it. I totally agree with you.

Extremely strange attitude to have, the guy was only trying to help.
Anyway, if I have understood correctly you are unsure if you can use free actions during your main action if your main action triggers multiple effects, the answer is yes you can. Another way to look at it is provided it's your turn and you haven't passed you can take a free action whenever you want.

Which way do you orientate the board?
Do you sit side on or at the bottom?
If your playing with others it's obviously side on but for solo I really can't seem to find a comfortable angle as I'm always reaching for cards or trying to see the research track.
Thanks in advance.

I've played both ways but it's definitely more practical to have the main board sideways on.

If your playing with others it's obviously side on but for solo I really can't seem to find a comfortable angle as I'm always reaching for cards or trying to see the research track.

When I play solo, I sit at the side of the board where the research track is.
The only hard thing to see is the new artifact when the row is refilled.
This works great for me.

Solo: I'm going side on with the research track nearest to me. I don't bother with the extra board for resources.

I try to take overhead shots of my setups to remind myself how I setup games. I need to take a higher overhead photo, but here is how I setup on my 30" x 70" table.

I sit on the side. (Either side.)
But that's mostly because of the table orientation. I don't like sitting at the head of the table.

I sit on the side of the table, but on the bottom of the board, yes cards are a bit far but it isn't too bad. I don't use the blue resource board, it isn't necessary in my opinion (

with the exception of that one campaign chapter

), i put the resources in small boxes or contain ers on the left and right.
The player board is in front of me with play area even closer to me. The solo board always to my right in games, not sure why.

I always have my solo opponent on the right, I'm right handed so maybe left handed folk default to the left side?
I've been trying out all of the suggestions and am now sitting with the research board side facing me, much better, even the cats are happy as they now have the other half of the table to themselves.

I always have my solo opponent on the right, I'm right handed so maybe left handed folk default to the left side?

Lefty here, can confirm - solo opponent 'stuff' for any game defaults to my left.

Thank you, that is very interesting, I don't think I've met a lefty before, I will have to add that to the initial questions for new players to our group or there could be issues if seated in the wrong place, just in case.

I just can't stand placing it sideways... It sucks imo when the artwork is rotated 90° when I want look at it and enjoy it. But I do not place the resource board underneath: just aside of the main board ,left side (rotated so it goes along with the main board, but for the resource board I don't mind) then under the main board I place my personal leader board. To the right of the main board goes the bots board.

I have just tried something on Boardgamearena and it wouldn't let me do it.
One of my gynecologists was placed on a site in the upper tier. I had 3 compasses.
I played from my hand the Whip (Exile this card to buy an artefact with a discount of 4 compasses).
I chose to buy Pathfinder's Staff (Relocate a placed gynecologist to a camp or level 1 site and activate it).
I chose to relocate my gynacologist on the top tier to an unexplored level 1 site.
It wouldn't let me.
I am wondering - why not. I had the required compasses. Is it something to do with "discovering" unexplored sites? If I can't do it then surely the card should read "Relocate a placed gynecologist to a
discovered
level 1 site or camp"?
Or is it my team are in the wrong field of expertise?

You are playing the game incorrectly, or playing a different game. Arnak has no gynecologists.

It must be a discovered site.
Sounds like that team is multiskilled though.

Do we have a ruling on this? Or am I missing something in the rules?

Thanks to you too Stephen. You and Pablo have both pointed me to the relevant rule. I might have been getting mixed up with Dice Hospital. Or maybe I wasn't.

A gynecologist with a whip and a staff is something to fear.
Sorry, I could not stop myself.

I think he is doing that on purpose, and I don't think it is funny.

The games were played exclusively with 4 players on
Bird Temple
. Base game, no expansions, no promos. The games were played under tournament conditions. All players had 4 months to prepare for the tournaments.
Here are some statistic of the played games - may be interesting for you:
Games played:
251 - all with 4 players (altogether: 1004 different and (mostly) well trained players)
VP:
32 – 105   Ø 69.1
VP of winner:
67 – 105   Ø 81.7
VP best 4th:
81
VP per game:
211 – 345
#Players ≥ 100 VP:

Distribution of victory points:

Ranking, win ratio and victory points depending on starting Position:

2   2.63    20.7 %     67.8
3   2.45    25.1 %     69.8
4   2.27    34.3 %     71.6
The second seat, which is often regarded as particularly favorable, turned out to be no particular advantage, whereas starting fourth is obviously the best option probably thanks to the starting resources. Being last in the first and fifth round does not seem to be a particular disadvantage.

Greetings from the
German Board Game Championship

I presume this is base game only, correct?

I presume this is base game only, correct?

Yes, correct. I added it in the original post.

Thank you!

What are the tournament conditions or rules?

I am also somewhat curious what 'played under tournament conditions' means here. I suspect it includes things like time limits, undos not allowed, etc.

Actually, third seat was already statistically shown to have the best win rate in 3p. The stats here corroborate those findings, suggesting that later seats do have an advantage due to the value of starting resources.
Interesting how there are many outliers from this tournament though. 32 VPs is quite clearly throwing the game. And a 67VP winner would likely be at an all-beginner table. All in all, sounds like it was a blast!

What are the tournament conditions or rules?

I am also somewhat curious what 'played under tournament conditions' means here. I suspect it includes things like time limits, undos not allowed, etc.

Full rule set can be found here:
https://dmmib.de/allgemeine-turnierregeln
https://dmmib.de/dm-2024/die-regeln
Main point may be:
- each player has only contributed one game to this statistic - so the statistics is from 1004 distinct players
- games were announced 4 months before the tournament -> time for preparation
- Tournament points are 5-3-2-1 for ranks 1-2-3-4 -> so it's worth taking risk to end in 1st place
- As soon as a move has been completed, it is valid. A cancellation is not permitted. Exception: The three other players at the table all agree to a cancellation of the move.
- The rules of fairness and fair play must be observed.
- Communication at the table is permitted and encouraged, but may not be used to influence the way other players play.
- slowest tables may get under observation of a referee to ensure they do not run out of time.

I thought it would be fun to rank the 8 games we played with a quick little review for each.
Lost Ruins of Arnak
is one of my favorite games and still squeaked into 1st place.  My friends had never played it, and it was by far their favorite game of the weekend!
:

No surprise to me, since it’s my #1 too.
Did you add

? That expansion makes the game infinitely replayable…


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello! The Lost Ruins of Arnak is one of my favorites and even though there are already two official expansions for it, I spent a lot of time thinking about new characters. I played 5-10 games with each character, refining them, but of course that doesn't mean it's completely balanced. In most cases, we played with just two players, always with one official character and one created by me.
All illustrations used are AI generated (tengr.ai) with a lot of post-processing in photoshop.
The characters:
The Padre
The Padre can visit occupied sites, without guardians, with a Fear card penalty.

Padre's cards

The Investor
The Investor can change 2 coins for 1 compass, or 3 coins for 2 compass as free action, any number of times.

Investor's cards

The Hunter
The Hunter start with the dog meeple. When he have an archaeologist at a site with guardian on it or flip face down an unused guardian, he can send the dog, with the usual travel cost, to dig at a tent site. Item cards and artifacts which manipulate archaeologists does not apply to dog.

Hunter's cards

The Gambler
The Gambler start with a special six sided dice.

Sick work! You are really skilled. Amazing.

I'm not going to use these characters (because I'm lazy, old, and don't have the technical means to recreate them), but I commend you on the quality of your work.  Well done sir, well done.

these are amazing!
i also don't have the means to create these, and i have yet to play all chars from the expansions i have.  but if i did and had, this expansion would be a great follow-up!
wonderful work!

Wow these do look really good.

Wow, absolutely incredible effort! Thank you so much for creating and sharing! They look fantastic fun!
As someone who hasn't sleeved any of the original cards, I don't think I will be able to get these printed so that the feel is identical, which kinda sucks - but where there's a will, they'll be way.
Maybe printing onto a really thing sticker for some of the fear cards, as there is far more than we've ever needed.

Awesome work! Would it be possible to upload high resolution PDFs? Especially of the cards and player boards. I want to print them professionally. Thanks so much!

I uploaded the player boards and cards at 300dpi pdf's to the drive, in folder "300dpi".

Really cool ideas.
So the dog can collect something from a tent site by paying travel costs, but only after sending an archeogist (or if you waste a boon)?
So it is essentially a limited worker right?

Yes, but not only send an archaeologist, you need to have an archaeologist at a site with guardian present.

So isn't Hunter just a worse version of Captain? Hunter got an additional archeologist, same as Captain, but the Dog is limited to tent sites and you have to spend resources (Guardian boon) or meet a condition to send him. Only advantage of the Dog is that you can use him twice in like 3rd or 4th round and onward. Since he is much weaker than normal archeologist, maybe remove the normal travel cost and place him for free?

I was thinking of the comparison as well.
I was thinking that the dog could be sent to any location that already had an archeogist for travel cost? (or same time for free?) the dog activates spot like normal. A guardian with a with a dog can be confronted for a discount(1 less resource, or pay something alternative like revolver). This benefit can be used by any player that shares location with dog.
P. S
Parhaps dogs can use boots as their wild travel costs. As they can basically get anywhere on their feet (mountain goats could really do that), that way they always need to pay but can use that fear for their benefit.

Only advantage of the Dog is that you can use him twice in like 3rd or 4th round. Since he is much weaker than normal archeologist, maybe remove the normal travel cost and place him for free?

After a few plays with him, in my opinion the Hunter isn't a worse version of Captain (funny to compare with Captain, because my wife always play with the Captain, and she rarely won). And yes, the dog is a limited worker, but the Hunter, during the 5 rounds, can send it up to eight times (best case) for resources, which is a lot. His card "Animal whisperer" is also a powerful card, and combined with "tracking", you can use a "good" guardian boon, multiple times. On the other hand, the captain starts with the "Hidden fear" card, which is worth -2 points. All in all, this is a fan made character, which requires a lot of testing and of course there is a chance that it is not very well balanced.

Is it possible to have editable files to make versions in other languages?
Thank you very much for the beautiful expansion you made :-)

Hello guys can you help me in this two different cases
1) In first case i want to know when i buy any Artifacts can i use just a half of effect
In this case on photo can i take only two gold and don't do reassure upgrade

2) In second case. When i discover any site and see this tile (where the YELLOW)

can i take for example (1) 1 tablet and 1 arrowhead or 2 tablets and dont do nothing?

1) + 2) yes you can. But of course some power is wasted...

In case 2, you may also take two tablets and upgrade a resource already on your board (an arrowhead to a ruby).

Yes to all of your questions.  The upgrade symbol is optional.
1) You may take the 2 gold and ignore the upgrade symbol.
2) You may take 1 tablet and 1 arrowhead, or you may take 2 tablets and ignore the upgrade symbol.  You may also take the 2 tablets and choose to upgrade some other resource that you already own.

"Is upgrade mandatory" is asked and answered before.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I learned the game (in French!), I was told that it is possible to use the free actions ONLY if you do also a "main action" during this turn.
This seems to be generally accepted in French-speaking reviews and explanations on YouTube...
Furthermore, based on the French-written rules, you have to (!) do those free actions AFTER this main action: «À votre tour, vous DEVEZ effectuer 1 action principale, PUIS vous choisissez... actions gratuites»  (literal translation: "On your turn, you MUST perform 1 main action, THEN you can ... free actions".
Still, when checking in the English-written rules, this is a completely different story!
«On your turn, you MAY perform 1 main action, PLUS ... free actions»
So my question is:
« based on your experience, is it better to
ⓐ allow free actions only if you do a main action is the same turn? (⇒ not it the last turn of mine)
ⓑ allow free actions to be made prior to the main one, or not? »
Thanks for your feedback!

You have to take a main action (unless you passed which is also a main action) and before and/or after it you can take any number of free actions.

The above is correct: you must do a main action, but 'pass' counts as a main action.
How odd if that's the French rules! It needs to be free actions at any time during your turn (the English rules say before, after or even during your main action).
Consider as an example: You want to discover a site and need to pay 3 compasses. You have 2 already so play a (basic) compass card as a free action to get a 3rd - then do your main action of discover a site.

OP: With reference to the English wording, you are correct that it says 'MAY'. Rules quoted below.
Main Actions On your turn you may perform one main action plus an unlimited number of free actions.
Main actions are:
Dig at a Site (page 9)
Discover a New Site (page 10)
Overcome a Guardian (page 11)
Buy a Card (page 12)
Play a Card (page 13)
Research (page 14)
Pass (page 17)
I'm not a grammar expert by any means, but I think this could have been written more clearly. Perhaps the word 'MAY' is referring to the fact that you may do free actions?

Thank you both for your answer!
I will now assume that:
① free actions are not only to be done after the main one (therefore disregarding this "
puis
" written in FR-rules!)
② allow free actions to be taken in the turn where one passes (as per consequence of ① and "passing" being the main action of this turn!)
This, indeed, makes perfect sense to me... but it requires assuming that an error was present in the FR-rules.
I will personally make this assumption (except if the authors are telling otherwise, obviously!)
Kind regards

Indeed, this approach (being probably a mistake) to force the free actions to be taken after the main one, will force players to more planning!
If you need 3 compasses for your next main action (or at least could... as maybe it will not be possible then!) and only have 2, it is at the end of the PREVIOUS turn that you need to play the free action to get the missing compass.
So this is still possible, simply you need to plan for it! And alays keeping more than one possibility open for your next turn is challenging for new players!

The part you're referring to is at the top of page 8 of french rulebook:

FR rules page 8 top

"
Actions principales
À votre tour, vous devez effectuer 1 action principale,
puis
vous choisissez d’effectuer ou non un nombre illimité d’actions gratuites."

There is indeed a mistake here ("puis" should be replaced by "et").
However, you have other references to free action in other places, that are written correctly:

FR rules page 7 bottom

2. Jouer
. [..] À votre tour, jouez 1  action principale ainsi qu’un nombre illimité d’actions gratuites.

FR rules page 8 bottom

Actions gratuites
[...] Lors de votre tour, vous pouvez effectuer autant d’actions gratuites que vous le souhaitez. Elles peuvent être effectuées avant, après et même pendant votre action principale.

This last place is, for me, the key part regarding free actions. This is the one that I remember - and somehow made me overlook the error  at the top of the page.

I agree that the top of page 8 is unclear. It's much more clear in the English rules.
But the description of the Pass action on page 17 states it in both versions.

À votre tour, vous pouvez choisir de passer : informez les autres joueurs que vous ne jouerez plus
aucun tour durant cette manche. Passer est l’action principale de votre tour. C’est le moment
d’utiliser les actions gratuites qui sont encore à votre disposition

Thank you both for your answer!

Yes thats how I've always played. It's fairly free and allows you some flexibility, and helps create combos. On the turn that I pass, I normally use up any free actions that might be lost, such as converting any coin cards in hand to actual coins, or using an assistant to get a resource.

Basically, you can do free actions whenever you want on your turn but you must do a main action.
Or another way to put it, if you cannot discover, dig,  defeat a guardian, buy a card, play a card or research, you MUST pass, but you can still use any remaining free actions before passing.

Since you can play free actions before or after your main action of a turn, you can also use remaining free actions
after
passing that turn, if you prefer.
(Indeed there are some free actions that require you to pass to gain an effect, so I think that formally you have to pass before using those cards for those actions.)

Interesting, and correct, I never thought about it that way.
Yes you are absolutely right - some Artifacts/Tools require you to Pass to activate the effect, or
improve
the effect, which may in turn lead you to wish to take a free action after passing.
So let me rephrase my original post; "if you cannot discover, dig, defeat a guardian, buy a card, play a card or research, you MUST pass (or "be passing"), and you can use any remaining free action either before or after passing, once you have finished a turn with a pass/"passing" main action, you cannot then play any further free actions within the same round as you have no further turns.
EDIT: Wait a sec, how the heck do you play a card if you have already passed?
EDIT again: I assume the only cards that have bonuses that activate when passing, are free actions (head explodes).

Any effect with a lightning bolt is a free action.

I never suggested it wasn't (?!)

Is it possible to use a ‚blue‘ slot on expansion leader boards with this card?

I'm not sure what you mean by a "blue" effect, but
please
edit your thread title from "
Rules question
" to some more useful and helpful for future forum readers like "
can totem use a blue effect
" or whatever.
(Also, is this card in the base game? Or should this thread be moved to an expansion forum?)

Is it possible to use a ‚blue‘ effect on the camp tile with this card?

The meaning on the card in English (for others to possibly assist) is take a Fear card and "Use any 1 totem (
i.e. idol
) slot effect on your player board".  I'm not sure what your question means.  The idol slots are on your player board, the camp tiles are irrelevant to the card's effect, except that you could use the aeroplane travel icon to pay the boot travel cost.
Do you perhaps mean the blue "wave" tokens covering up the unused worker spots in less-than-4-player games?  You can't use those for anything. (I think there may be a card that allows you to visit the covered-up second slot, but if so, this isn't it).

I think they mean the blue idol slots on the expansion leader boards. They're calling them camp spots because the base game ones have a tent on them?

Expedition Leaders add personal effects to the list of possible idol effects (which can usually only be used by placing an idol on the (for most leaders) third and fourth slot, i.e. 3 and 4 vp slots)
Since the aforementioned card doesn't narrow its use or specify something more specific, the answer is "yes, you can use <any> of the idol effects."

Agreed about the thread title.
If you click on the image and then zoom in, you can see an eagle head near the bottom edge of the card.
So the card is from the expansion

.
Also, the question is about the blue idol spaces on your player board, which are introduced in the expansion

.
Hence, this thread must be moved to the forum of the expansion.

Since the aforementioned card doesn't narrow its use or specify something more specific, the answer is "yes, you can use <any> of the idol effects."

This is correct.

Sorry for the confusion.
It is difficult to ask if you have completely different wordings in a different language/version of the game.
Edit everything.

Okay, you understood my question.
I was just curious because this card was pretty strong in the hands of the mystic guy.

Is there any platform that allows me to play Arnak solo?

Is there any platform that allows me to play Arnak solo?

I wish! But no.
But I play it with a BGGer in Copenhagen so I’d be happy to have a very low key friendly game with you when I return home next week. Just Geekmail me if you want.

Is there any platform that allows me to play Arnak solo?

You could use the fan made Vassal module!
It works well.
In the Vassal module, you can search for online games (multiplayer), or play offline (solo or multiplayer).
The current module (1.0) only has all stuff from the base game (both sides of game board are available).
Vassal runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and any other system which has Java.
Download and install Vassal 3.7.8 or later from
https://vassalengine.org/download.html
.
Then download the vmod from
https://vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Lost_Ruins_of_Arnak
.
Don't forget to read/copy the comments section on the vmod page, because is has important information about handling cards, amount of resources, and assistants.
Start Vassal engine, click "File", "Open module..." and click on the downloaded vmod. This has to be done only once. After the first time, the module will be listed within Vassal engine and you can double click to start the vmod.
Have fun!

Not an online platform, but this scripted TTS mod includes the solo mode. It contains loads of automation and makes the gameplay a breeze.

Hello, not really fan of beat your own score. Is there a way to do win/loss condition in the base game?

Well, the way the solo works is that you play against an automated Rival. You have to beat their score while it blocks you in any way it can.

the newest expansion can sort of achieve that

the newest expansion can sort of achieve that

To be clear, the base game
already
achieves it.

exactly.
Solo mode from base game is an automate that simulates an adversary.
No beat "your own score" at all in any version/expansion - at least official
The latest expansion (missing expedition) adds a campaign to the solo mode, but does not change its mechanism

We were playing last night and one of the level 1 sites came into play where the boon was 2 tablets and an upgrade icon (tablet-to-arrow-arrow-to-ruby).  We were not 100% sure on how this tile is allowed to be played.
So the player that gets this tile ...  are they allowed to upgrade one of the two tablets to an arrowhead  ?
or are they only allowed to upgrade an existing supply item for that part of the boon ?
I thumbed through the Level 1 tile deck after we finished playing and also noticed another tile that the player receives an arrowhead and an upgrade option as well that would fall under this same question.

You can yes. You can Upgrade one of the 2 tablets won by the site or any already in your possession





This is a site from the first expansion. I’ve marked this thread to be moved to the appropriate forum.

Sorry about that ...  I have not played the expansion yet, but had merged in the new tiles and cards to the base game and didn't realize I was posting in the wrong place.

In this expansion there is also a Level 2 site tile gaining you 1 coin, 1 arrowhead, 1 upgrade, 1 card draw.
Yes, you can use the upgrade to turn the gained arrowhead into a jewel.

Hi,
I have this game for a while and would like to play it, but since I'm missing some logic concerning the "guardians", I always get stuck at the discovering rule.
Oh yes, I think I understand the rules telling me that whenever I discover a site a "guardian" appears, and I can imagine the amount of fear this inflicts, leaving you with fear cards whenever you leave the site without overcoming the horrible creature.
It's just the fact that
they don't even try to prevent you from taking anything
that disturbs my logic and prevents me from reading on.
It's not mentioned to be an abstract game (there is a storyline and some great artwork), but that part of the game fails to convince me and feels as abstract to me as
"when the yellow piece of plastic reaches the blue dot, you get 2 points and you may move the red wooden thing 1 place forward"
I just fail to explain to myself what are these horrible looking blind pets doing there?
Any suggestions? I really think this is probably a great game, but I need a logic boost - not only for myself, but for every future player I wish to introduce the game to.
Thx in advance.

My mental model is they're there first off to make sure you don't destroy anything.  So collecting artifacts for "science & exploration" is ok.  And if you prove yourself worthy of their respect they reward you.  There's some stretching there I admit, but I really do like that they befriend and reward you once you've proven your mettle.

Thx for the reply.
Seems to be a reasonable explanation that I can try to live with, but I wish to keep the discussion open to hear some other theories.

Only if you successfully take them! Otherwise the value you get from the site is negated by the lost 5 points (or 10 if a rival takes it) and the lost Guardian boon.
You stole the resources and idols but it was very costly to do so without taming the Guardian!

Good point!

Have you not seen the film where the protagonist sneaks into the temple, creeps past the traps and guards, grabs the relic, and RUNS?

Have you not seen the film where the protagonist sneaks into the temple, creeps past the traps and guards, grabs the relic, and RUNS?

Yeah... He did this 10 times in a row and didn't have to take any fear cards
That's a script. He knew it was gonna work that way because the script director told him so
In a game, rules write the script. If there is a guard or something, they usually don't mean automatic success.
Imagine the rules of chess to be written that one can share the same space as his opponent without any consequences
Your kind of game?

You apppear to have misunderstood the OP. He wonders why the Guardians aren’t  tougher to overcome, including preventing your archaeologist from getting any resources from the dig.
He isn’t trying to make the game easier, as your example would do.

I think there's a bit of confusion here.
The reason for this post is to find some explanation for the fact that there is a feature in the game that doesn't work as expected (Guardians just sitting there dealing fear cards while forgetting to GUARD the treasures and offer some kind of extra challenge).
Oh yes, the example of the protagonist cunningly avoiding the guardians crossed my mind too, but at least in the movie there was some suspence (even if you were almost certain he would succeed).
In the game, they say: Here's a treasure guarded by a creature - The creature inflicts fear on you - But you can do whatever you want, there's no danger involved.

Apart from the danger of accumulating a deck full of fear cards that can tank an entire round for you.

I think there's a bit of confusion here.

That’s just wrong. Apart from the fear cards mentioned above, if you fail to tame a Guardian and an opponent then does so, you lose 10 points to them plus the boon. I lost at least one BGA game that way…

"Uhhh, sir?  I think you should see this."
You turn to see your faithful assistant hold their torch up to a seemingly unremarkable wall that is overgrown with vines.  You squint; trying to see what they see.  Suddenly a tiny flash of light catches your attention:  the illumination from the torch reflecting off of tiny motes of dust.  Particles that indicate an open space behind the thicket of vines.  Before your mind can decide on the best tool to remove the vines, you find yourself excitedly ripping them apart with your bare hands.
You gesture towards the newly-revealed and darkened doorway for your assistant to enter first.  It IS their discovery after all.
"A-after you, sir.  I-I insist.", he stammers.
Stepping through you find a large empty chamber.  Empty save for a small plinth in the center of the room that holds the largest ruby you've ever seen.  The room is pitch black except for a trickle of sunlight that beams through the ceiling, highlighting the gem.  Weary of traps, you walk carefully towards the center of the room.
"This seems too easy..."  Your assistant's interjection breaks your focus.  You find yourself standing an arm's length from the red gem with no awareness of how you got there.  You examine the platform in front of you.  It really does seem like an ordinary stone column.  There are no obvious mechanisms for you to worry about.  You take the ruby, carefully wrapping it in a scrap of cloth, and stuff it into your satchel.
You bate your breath, waiting for some terrible fate to befall you.  After a moment that feels like an hour, the pounding of your heart in your chest confirms that you are still alive.  When you finally exhale, the force of your breath blows the sunlight out of the room like a child extinguishing a birthday candle.  Wait...that doesn't make sense.
Before you can figure out what just happened, an enormous crash pierces the stillness in the room.  Looking up, you see an unearthly creature descending upon you with wingspan longer than a city bus.
If you have an Arrowhead and a Plane Icon (representing time spent):
You brace yourself as the creature races towards you.  You're not a paleontologist, but you're pretty sure this creature is the missing link between birds and dinosaurs.  You reach into your bag for ANYTHING that would help you.  Journal, no?  Ruby, no!?  AHA!  Your palm brushes against the hilt of a bejeweled dagger that you found earlier in your expedition.  You hope it's sharp enough to get the job done.  Drawing it from your satchel, you brandish it the beast.  It seems to recognize the threat and slow its approach.
It lands with a cacophonous thud mere meters away; glowering at you.  It doesn't make any sense, but you feel like it wants to say something.  The head of the reptilian raptor cranes towards you so slowly that it doesn't feel like a threat.  It stops its movement a few dozen centimeters from your face.  Hesitantly, you crouch to lay your weapon on the ground between you.  As you stand, you reach back out with an open hand to show that you mean no harm.  You are surprised when the creature bows its head in a gesture that seems like a human show of respect.  You place your empty palm on the creature's head and close your eyes.
After a few moments, the creature lifts its head and soundlessly soars back through the ceiling from whence it came.  Your gaze follows it upwards and you are surprised to see a full moon gazing back at you from where you had just seen the sun what seemed like minutes earlier.
Daring not to disturb the delicate detente between you and the beast, you leave the dagger where it lies.  You turn back towards your assistant as you absentmindedly feel the side of your bag; your hand running over the bulk of the ruby you just procured.  You have contributed to a remarkable discovery today and earned the respect of a terrifying creature.  Somehow you feel that the two of you will meet again...
If you DO NOT have an Arrowhead and a Plane Icon:
The creature lands with a cacophonous thud mere meters away; letting out an unearthly roar that you sense hasn't been heard by human ears in millennia.  You turn to flee, shouting for your assistant to get a headstart.  As you rush towards the exit you thank whatever God(s) exist(s) that the beast has wings instead of more legs.  It's beastly maw snaps mere centimeters from your heels as you run for your life towards the door.  Diving for the narrow entrance you land hard on the rocky ground as the enormous bulk of the creature slams into the wall behind you.  You roll over to face your demise as a cascade of particulate debris showers you.  To your relief, the doorway is too small for the creatures ample head and it doesn't seem to have the strength to crash through rock when it isn't diving from the heavens.
You quickly and quietly vacate the area as you absentmindedly feel the side of your bag; your hand running over the bulk of the ruby you just procured.  You're glad to have something to show for today's expedition because it's going to be a long, long time before you work up the courage to return here...

The reason for this post is to find some explanation for the fact that there is a feature in the game that doesn't work as expected (Guardians just sitting there dealing fear cards while forgetting to GUARD the treasures and offer some kind of extra challenge).

But there
is
an extra challenge: you have to use up some of your valuable resources to overcome them. Whether you interpret this as an offering to placate the guardian or weaponry (eg the arrowhead) to subdue them, you have to overcome them in some way to prevent fear overcoming you (and to earn five victory points and another future benefit (the boon)).

It's just the fact that
they don't even try to prevent you from taking anything
that disturbs my logic and prevents me from reading on.

They are not guards, they are guardians. Maybe you should think of them as having a spiritual connection to the site which you have stumbled into rather than a protective connection to the treasure at the site?

Frank, you sound like a fun guy to play Arnak with. How do you like the new expansion?

I haven't had a chance to play yet!  It should be on its way though and I'm hoping it arrives before the end of my upcoming week long vacation.

I’ve never heard Indy saying anything about fear cards, victory points or something like that.
For me, the point is not how much advantage or disadvantage one gets when leaving the guardians alone.
The point is:
What the hell are they doing there?

storywise

THIS !!!!!
To all you talking about point advantage and fear cards: I don’t bother!
It’s the
storyline explanation
that I’m after!!!
I’m sure the rules make up for good gameplay.
I just want these same rules to tell me a story that I can cope with.

FWIW it's a strategy eurogame with an archaeology/exploration theme, not a story-oriented game with a coherent narrative.

To all you talking about point advantage and fear cards: I don’t bother!

storyline explanation

Well, the rulebook in fact is a diary:

Day 7 – How strange it is to be here, to finally see what we have strived so long to find!
I feel, sometimes, as though we are encamped on sacred ground.
What wonders lie ahead? What dangers?
We have
no inkling of the secrets this island holds, but we vowed to unveil them, and that we shall do!
Day 8 – Though our eagerness to begin is mixed with a certain amount of trepidation, now is not the time to let
our courage fail.
If there are dangers, well, we came here to confront them.
To the jungle then, and no delay!
Day 9 – We brought a ladder to the site and climbed to get a better look at the carvings. As we had hoped, it was
writing! If such wonders lie so close to camp, who knows what we shall find once we truly begin to explore!
Day 10 – Our archaeology team returned with fantastic tales of dwellings in the cliffs adorned with lapidary
masterpieces still intact.
Yet their joy at their discovery was mingled with dread of the monster that lurked above.
Day 11 – We fought the monstrous creature hand to hand, knife to claw! The beast went down!
But none could strike the death blow. We stood in awe. The beast bowed its head, acknowledging us.
And we realized, then, that this was no monster. No,
this creature was one of Arnak’s legendary guardians.

FWIW it's a strategy eurogame with an archaeology/exploration theme, not a story-oriented game with a coherent narrative.

I know this is not an Ameritrash game with a deep storyline, but it isn’t an abstract game either.
There is some kind of a background story with a hole in the middle. If that doesn’t bother you, I have no prob with that, but I want to hear how others translate this from rules to story.

How do you translate other games from rules to story? I’d love an example. Because Arnak doesn’t seem any different from any other non-narrative game IMHO.

Obviously you have not played the latest

expansion…


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bought a used copy with the expansions included. Would like to play base game only first (some new players, I've only played base game once before).
I think I've sorted out all the base game components (guardians, idols etc), but all the cards (items and artifacts) are still mixed.
Is there a list or identifier for the base game cards, or is it ok to play base game with all the cards - even for new players - (I think that's what at least one expansion rulebook suggests)?
Any help appreciated

Yes! On the bottom corner on every card or token there is a little symbol that shows it is for the expansion.

I know that the cards, at least, from the Leaders expansion have a little eagle head at the bottom, and I think the other components do as well.
You can certainly leave them mixed in - it won't be a problem for new players. What could make a difference is the board side (one is easier) and the temple you use. If you use the expansion temples, they will be harder to advance without using the Leaders.
I don't know how the 2nd expansion works.

Every artifact and item has a small symbol on the bottom of the card, if it's an expansion component

The symbol is very small and can be easily missed, so you'll have to look closely
Here are some cards from 1st expansion (maybe not all) taken from an existing bgg image
if you look closely at the bottom center of the card, you maybe able to see the eagle icon - but barely. Little Monkey card is where I can see it best.

There's no real need to take the expansion cards out (or indeed the new guardian, site and assistant tiles), they are all quite playable with the base game and don't depend on using expedition leaders, for example.  They just provide more variety.  You might need the back of the expansion rules or a player aid to clarify some iconography, but there are no new rules for using them.  I've recently taught the base game to a couple of people with the cards mixed in and it wasn't an issue.

I always play with everything in, and the only changes I make depending on players experience is to play with leaders or basic explorers, and which map and track to use.

Many thanks to everyone for the help!

You are correct.
ALL
components from the

are marked with a small eagle head (see rulebook, at the bottom of page 3).
ALL
components from the

are marked with a small airplane symbol (see rulebook, page 2).

The Sea Turtle's effect is to take another card from your pile and then place a worker on a site for one boat symbol. However, playing a card is a 'main' action' and so is placing a worker, so how does this card effect work?

Generally the effect of a card can combine many effects. More powerful cards can accomplish quite a bit.
Can you post a photo of the card, or include the full card text?

There is already a photo on bgg:

The Sea Turtle's effect is to take another card from your pile and then place a worker on a site for one boat symbol. However, playing a card is a 'main' action' and so is placing a worker, so how does this card effect work?

Well, in general card abilities trump basic rules. This happens with other cards as well, like fishing rod, precision compass, journal ....

The Sea Turtle's effect is to take another card from your pile and then place a worker on a site for one boat symbol. However, playing a card is a 'main' action' and so is placing a worker, so how does this card effect work?

The fallacy in your reasoning is that "placing a worker" is
not
a main action.
Discovering a site (for example) is a main action, and it indeed lets you place a worker.
Playing a card is also a main action, and it
also
lets you place a worker, if the card's effect says you can place a worker... which this card does.

The Sea Turtle's effect is to take another card from your pile and then place a worker on a site for one boat symbol. However, playing a card is a 'main' action' and so is placing a worker, so how does this card effect work?

Note from the image of the card above that it's not place an archaeologist for one boat symbol, it's place one with a
discount
of one boat symbol, so if, for example, the site needed one boat to travel to (or one boot), the travel cost would already be covered.

There is already a photo on bgg:

The way I see it is playing the card and following it through is the main action. So take a card from your deck and play an available archeologist at the mentioned discount.

The way I see it is
playing the card and following it through is the main action
. So take a card from your deck and
play
dig or discover a site with an available archeologist at the mentioned discount.

I changed your quote to make it complete and correct. I hope you don't mind. The bold is the simplest way to explain it I think.

If you just take the rulebook and read the back side (page 24), you can read:

and

So, when you perform the gained Dig at a site action, you have a discount of 1 boat (which also count as a boot).
When you perform the gained Discover a new site action, you still have to pay the compass cost and you also have a discount of 1 boat.

If you just take the rulebook and read the back side (page 24), you can read:

So, when you perform the gained Dig at a site action, you have a discount of 1 boat (which also count as a boot).
When you perform the gained Discover a new site action, you still have to pay the compass cost and you also have a discount of 1 boat.

Thanks

I'm new and i must say a bit lost in these ruins.
i've played once in person and maybe now twice on BGA, spare ya'll with the resume but have been a 'heavy' gamer for nearly 20 years and none of the mechanics are necessarily new or confusing. Playing well though...has me perplexed.
What's a good starting strategy, my first in person game i kind of went with a card strategy and i enjoyed the game and didnt play optimally having mucked up one of my turns, i dont believe that one turn cost me a victory but it cost me from being in contention. Now playing again on BGA, where i could better take in the board and all the options i've done even worse.
I feel a bit crippled by the varying options and can't really find a means as to what to focus on or even to try to go with a balance. the game may not be for me and that's all good, but i've had a handful of games that took me a few plays to get over the 'hump' so to speak which then turned into some of my favorite games, such as brass, tta, race for the galaxy. So i'm here to raise my hand to ask for some assistance on what might be a good means for approaching this game.
My first game i had way too many cards, i wasn't seeing most of them, and i didnt make up enough points to be competitive with the other players, this past game i have too few cards and even worked out the starting fear cards from my hand. None of us really got very far on the technology track so while i think that would seem a good strategy i dont feel as a bad as perhaps the variable card/camps drawn this game didnt really allow for it.
Anyways, thanks for help/tips.
cheers

You may have a look at strategy threads such as

which is quite good.
For instance over there, first comment for beginners is: that is (mostly) not a deck building game

I generally play a lean deck and build my game around 2-3 key items acquired early.  Learning the value of the items is a major part of the game.  Learning to maximize research for assistants, bonuses and resources is the other.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Around the time of the release of the base game Mín kindly posted this:

It shows the symbols used on various components along with their translation.
At that time I resolved to work through these and discover further meaning behind many of the game elements. However, after a quick review (of the tablets) it seemed too garbled and I left it, until now.
Sadly, it still seems somewhat garbled!
...but that might just be me.
I share my ponderings here in case any of you fellow 'Arnakians' out there can help clarify/confirm. I've posted my prosaic (made-up!) interpretation followed by [the more literal] translation.
Note: the runes seem (from the temple track, for example) to be read vertically instead of horizontally, so that is how I have translated the tablets too. The '???' are where the symbols are not clear or else are missing from Mín's list.
Also, the 2nd page in the above image is partly obscured so I cannot make out the full names of some of the Sacred Guardians.
In order, I have:
Ara-Anu
Kar-Kal...
Artan
Telka...
Net...
Thanks to Elwen (and Mín) for the further blog info shared below) I can confirm the Sacred Guardians as:
Ara-Anu [Main God, Bird]
Kar-Kal [Great Snake]
Artan/Artel [Prophet]
Telkal [River Goddess]
Neto [Monkey Goddess]
and Te-Anu [Tree Guardian]
Here are the images that give the further insights:

The Tablets:
Col 1. In the beginning, ???, ???, was opened. [origin/beginning, ???, ???, Open]
Col 2. The prophet sees the path, all of the way. [prophet, see, path, all]
Col 3. Find, ???, star, <broken tablet hides any further> [find, ???, star, <broken tablet>]
Edit: in this post I mistakenly only deciphered 1 Temple tile for each Level of the Temple.  In a subsequent post I attempt to go into more detail, with all 20 Temple tiles.
Temple Tile - 2 Value
Col 1. Welcome is an offering of water. [accept, offering, water]
Col 2. New worship offering. [new, worship, offering]
Along bottom - water, give, water (it's possible the icons refer to Telka, instead of, or, in addition to, water) [water, give, water]
Temple Tile - 6 Value
Col 1. The prophecy of old tells of a fiery path. [prophecy, old, fire, path]
Col 2. The prophecy of old tells of the rise of a snake. [prophecy, old, fire, snake]
Temple Tile - 11 Value
Col 1. Make an offering to the ancient, Ara-Anu. Worship this noble guardian and they shall provide. [offering, old, Ara-Anu, worship, high/noble, give]
Col 2. The stars tell us that Ara-Anu will fly like the wind. [star, profit, pray, travel, air/wind]
The Bird Temple Track
Level 3 Col 1:
We are together under the stars of ages. [oneness, star, old]
Level 3 Col 2:
Ara-Anu, ???, ??? [Ara-Anu, unknownx2]
Level 3 Col 3:
Kar-Kal offerings [Kar-Kal, offering]
Level 5:
Ahead lies the path to Artan. [path, Artan]
Level 6: Col 1:
The seers say this is the path to enlightenment [prophet, path, wisdom]
Level 6: Col 2:
In the beginning there was one star, so said Ara-Anu [origin, oneness, star, beak]
Level 6: Col 3:
Long ago, Ara-Anu spoke of freedom. [ancient, beak, open, path]
The Snake Temple Track
Level 3 Col 1:
In the beginning, you may find your way with the stars. [origin, find, star]
Level 3 Col 2:
Rivers must be traversed. [water]
Level 4 Col 1:
The seers say this is the path to enlightenment [prophet, path, wisdom]
Level 4 Col 2:
In the beginning there was one star, so said Ara-Anu [origin, oneness, star, beak]
Level 4 Col 3:
Long ago, Ara-Anu spoke of freedom. [ancient, beak, open, path]
Level 4 Col 4:
Kar-Kal, requests an offering. [Kar-Kal, offering]
Level 5: Col 1:
Kar-Kal [Kar-Kal, <obscured>]
Level 5: Col 2:
Cast an offering to the fire and pray. [offering, fire, worship]
Level 5: Col 3:
Ara-Anu speaks wisely of their lands. [beak, wisdom, home]
Level 6: Col 1:
Artan is as old as the stars. [Artan, old, star]
Level 6: Col 2:
Temples of knowledge are built high into the sky.  [build, wisdom, air/wind]
Level 6: broken tablet 1
Prophets look to the ancient stars. [prophet, ancient, star]
Level 6: broken tablet 2
In the beginning, ??? [origin, <broken>]
Level 7: Col 1:
Kar-Kal, lives with the snakes. [Kar-Kal, dwell, snake]
Level 7: Col 2:
They possess power over fire and water [command, fire, water]
The Lizard Temple Track
(snake here may be interpreted as reptile/lizard?)
Level 2 Col 1:
Sacrifices are made through the ages. [offering, ancient]
Level 2 Col 2:
??? the seers agree. [???, prophet, accept]
Level 3:
Artan's path is guided by stars. [Artan, path, star]

The Monkey Temple Track
Level 5 Col 1:
An old foreseeing of snakes. [ancient, snake, prophecy]
Level 7:
Sacrifices of ages, ??? [ancient, offering, ???]
Do let me know if you have a better take on any of this.

Super cool, never had an inkling of any of this! Interested to see what the community comes up with. Good work!

Hi Paul and all Arnakologists!
You might find a few more hints, bits of useful information (and links to more resources) in the following blogpost that Mín published in 2020.
https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/109783/designer-diary-los...
But honestly, your findings are already quite impressive!
I don't think anyone came closer to deciphering the hidden Arnak texts without seeing Mín's world-building documents.

Hi Elwen.  Thank you so much for the kind words.
It looks like that blog post came out a few months before the image I used in my OP and I can only assume I either missed the blog, or didn't make the mental note at that time to decipher the runes. Not sure, but I was very eagerly anticipating the arrival of TLRoA - it landed (for me) on 4th Dec, so I'm guessing I was in complete hype mode when the image was posted (10th Dec) as I commented on that at the time.
Anyway - I missed those extra details from the blog, so thank you again for re-sharing it here.
I can now clearly see all the names of what I'm terming 'The Sacred Guardians' (Mín titles them as 'Sacred' in the image), so I'll update the main post with those.
Also, there are groups of similar icons, so it seems more than one might represent Ara-Anu, or Artel, for example.  I'll have a think about those and anything else I spot there and update the OP accordingly again.
Thanks to you both and the entire production team for the continuing adventures.
Edit: ah - I see now that the Sacred Guardians (symbols) are composites of some other symbols.  Very cool.

The top of the page makes clear how 2 or three icons/symbols become one in the Sacred Guardian icons.
Further Edit:  Oh there's more!!   I'm so silly.
I forgot about a feature of some of the base game components.  I'll post an update with more attempted translations in due course.  Might take a little while, unless someone beats me to it!

It’s been a while since my last post on this.
In my OP I forgot the fact that the temple tiles are many and varied. There are in fact 8 individual tile-types for Levels 1 & 2, and 4 different ones for level 3 (20 story tiles in total). In the OP I only attempted to decipher 1 such tile for each level. Having realised my mistake I set out to remedy it and try to make sense of each of the tiles.
And, oh, what a journey!  I have truly felt (a little) like an archaeologist discovering the runes and daubings of a lost civilisation and trying to piece together their lore.  However, I am in no way qualified to do that, so what follows may be a long way from the world Min and Elwen have intended.
Please note that some may wish to work this out for themselves, so whilst I have not used spoiler tags to hide the content, you may wish to stop reading now and only come back to check your own results against mine.
First, some key notes, doubts and unknowns:
1. My attempt to piece this together is bound to be flawed. There are too many avenues for error for it to be otherwise. That said, there must equally be aspects of what I share here that are correct. I invite a discussion about what is ‘correct’ and what is dubious.
2. Some runes on the tablets, temple track, cards and temple tiles seem to be missing from Min's posts.
There are other components with additional runes and more on them.  I will address them in a subsequent post. Here I focus on just the Temple Tiles.
I have written my interpretation next to the image of the tile. Then in bold square brackets the ‘direct’ meaning of the runes.
3. Artan & Artel seem to be names for the same Sacred Guardian, appearing in different lists of the Runes.  I am using the name Artan throughout as this seems to be the later designation. I could be missing something here.
4. There is a rune for ‘star’ (a simple square, on its corner). There is another which is very similar but with pointed/extended corners. It is probably no accident that these point to North, East, South and West. I am terming this “Artan-star” as it is essentially a star but is also part way from the star rune toward the rune for Artan. Again, no accident, I believe.
5. The sequence of the tiles is also guesswork based on my interpretation of their content. I tried looking at how they were configured on the original punch boards but I no longer think that is significant - I may be wrong about that too.
Are you ready?
<get on with it!!>
Here we go.
Temple Tiles - Level 1 (Value 2)

1. The settlers travelled to Arnak, built new settlements, made a home and raised a small civilisation (or is this a rise in power/esteem?).
[Travel, build, home, rise]
Over the image are stars. The image is of trader with trading goods in boat. Some precious cargo.
They came to trade in order to gain greater rewards.  (this is how trade works, but becomes a reference to the guardian exchanges)
[Give, better]
Central rune of
Travel
.

Artan-star over statue of Ara-Anu.
(in the picture we also see the air / wind icon in the sky-left)
Centre:
Ara-Anu
rune.
So, they discover the first hint of what is within Arnak.

1. The Mountain will provide great knowledge to those who traverse it.
[Mountain, wisdom]
2. There resides a secret and nobility (or high power) will be attained.
[Secret, high/noble]
3. The mountain is Neto
[Neto]
Central Rune:
Offering
Picture shows settlers worshipping at an obelisk, there is a nearby statue (monolith - tribute to Neto?) and a tree.
Also, if the game board is viewed, there is smoke rising from the ‘mountain’. Clearly a volcano. Clearer still from the Snake Temple side.

1. The new islanders came to worship the Guardians and made more offerings to placate them.
[Pray, water, offering, ancient]
2. A prophecy was shared, of a journey that would be made.
[Prophecy, path]
Main image of follower presenting precious item to guardian (massive toad-thing - as per one Guardian tile)
3. Along this journey, secrets will be unearthed and wisdom gained.
[Secret, wisdom, ??obscured-by-VP]
Central rune of
Offering
.

1. The settlers prayed to the Guardians, made offerings and the Guardians became restful/peaceful
[rest , pray, offering]
2. The settlers prayed to the Guardians, made offerings and the Guardians became restful/peaceful
[rest , pray, offering]
Central image of followers offering and one befriending a beast
Central rune is of
Acceptance
The repetition of the runes is an indication that this happened many times.

1. Welcome is an offering of water.
[accept, offering, water]
2. Worshipping a new Sacred Guardian with an offering.
[new, worship, offering]
Along bottom - The runes refer to Telka in addition to water)
[water, give, Telka, water]
Central Rune:
Telka

Maybe the message here is of a star heralding the arrival of a prophesied settler that would become a noble ally to Ara-Anu and the other Guardians of Arnak.
Stars over image, then
[path]
, then
[star, pray, travel]
Main image (left to right) is of Ara-Anu, then a crudely drawn ‘sacrifice’ or just a follower? And then Artan? In a valley?
The Central rune is the
Artan-star
. Becoming Artan?

1. The star(s) aided the settlers arrival, the tree (Ten-Anu) has directed them towards the mountain (Neto) that is their path
[Mountain, Tree, star]
2. Visit the fire that is signposted by the (Artan-)star. There resides (Kar-Kal the sacred) a great snake
[Fire, Artan-star, snake]
Centre: image has falling stars and Artan (the rune below and this image confirms it as Artan)
3. Unsure about this
[Artan-star, air, ??obscured-by-VP]
4. Unsure about this
[Water, fish, ??obscured-by-VP]
Central Rune:
Artan
Temple Tiles - Level 2 (Value 6)
While the whole thing is a muddle, I am particularly torn on ideas and sequencing of these level 2 tiles.
Overall it seems as though there is a battle of light and dark (snakes) with Kar-Kal being the light. I believe Kar-Kal provides the follower (Artan_rising), with the powerful Hammer artefact that can be used to overcome the fire snake(s).  That's (perhaps) the main thrust here. Now I will attempt to show this as a sequence. It is messy though, meaning I am probably, at least partly, wrong about it.

1. Behold the Ancient Kar-Kal
[Ancient, Kar-Kal]
2. Wind, Water and Fire will be met with on this journey before its end
[Air, water, fire, end]
I’m a little unsure about the snakes/Kar-Kal coming from the sky here. Is it that the lightning resembles ‘snakes of fire’?
So, the runes of ‘air’, ‘water’ and ‘fire’ represent an electrical storm?
Or, as I expand on below, that the volcano bursts lava into the sky which then rains down over Arnak (fiery snakes from the sky), perhaps along with an electrical storm?

1. The ancient prophecy tells of a path beset with fire.
[Prophecy, old, fire, path]
2. The ancient prophecy tells of the reawakening of a great snake.
[Prophecy, old, Rise, Snake]
Image appears to be of sacrifices (or figures falling) to the snakes in a pit (volcano?)

1. The great snake is ancient
[Old, snake]
2. The star lights the way
[Star]
3. Beware the fire
[Fire]
Is Kar-Kal analogous to the dormant, then reawakened eruption of a volcano?

1. The great snake is ancient. The prophecy warns of fire.
[Old, snake, fire, prophecy]
2. The star lights the way
[Star]
3. Beware the fire
[Fire]
4. The star lights the way (to a higher power? Artan?)
[Star]
Beneath snake is the Artan-star

1. Wisdom is provided by the Tree, across the river - of how to overcome Kar-Kal.
[Wisdom, tree]
2. This is the ancient Tree Guardian Ten-Anu
[Ancient, Ten-Anu]
Image of follower worshipping Ten-Anu - water runes are shown between them

1. A peaceful negotiation. This is Kal-Kar's home. After an offering is made they impart wisdom.
[Home, offering]
2. Kar-Kal shares wisdom of how Air (Ara-Anu) and Water (Kal-Kar) were united since the beginning and of how Water and Air will combine to win over fire.
[Air, water, origin, oneness, wisdom, Kar-Kal]
Runes shown on Kar-Kal: ancient/old, snake, water

1. Kar-Kal has shared knowledge of how to bring an end to the terror of the dark snakes. Prepare well.
[Kar-Kal, end, prepare]
2. A new era beings as Artan learns to command the water with the mystical hammer (see artefact) to win the battle against the dark snakes.
[Beginning, water, command]
Image of dark snake swallowing Artan-star and Artan using staff to command the water.
{Water tames the lava (snake) of the volcano?}

1.
[Ancient, Kar-Kal, rest, pray]
- Kar-Kal rests (lava is solidified to rock) pray to Kar-Kal (to keep him placated/dormant)
2.
[Prepare, star, end]
- prepare for the end of the terror of the great snake (lava)
centre : Artan-star
3.
[Open, fire, dwell]
- the fiery volcano is where the snake resides and will now lie dormant (for now)
4.
[Artan-star, snake, mountain]
- Artan is rising, where the star shines over the snake of the mountain (lava of the volcano)
Note: the bottom left of this image appears to show the head of a slumbering giant reptile, but that may just be an optical illusion that I can't seem to unsee. Apologies!
Temple Tiles - Level 3 (Value 11)
I think the Level 3 tiles are a summary of events

1. The Artan-star leads to the mountain…
[Artan-star, mountain]
2. ... where ancient truths will be  learned …
[Old, wisdom]
3. ... then return home - to share the wisdom with followers.
[Travel, home]
Centre: image of
Ten-Anu
and then a lead-settler displaying a glowing mountain rune to the followers.

1. Artan makes offerings and prays to the ancient sacred Guardian Ara-Anu. [Offering, ancient, Ara-Anu, pray, noble, give]
2. The great prophet Artan has travelled far to worship Ara-Anu, God of the skies.
[Artan-star, prophet, pray, travel, air]
Centre:
Artan-star
Image of Lead-settler with staff gesturing to Ara-Anu.

1. The offerings of Artan are accepted by the sacred guardians Ara-Anu and Kar-Kal.
[Ancient, offering, pray, noble, accept]
2. Artan shall in return have (or has demonstrated) command over Water, air, stone and fire.
[Water, air, stone, fire, command]
Centre:
Home
The followers may call this home and share the lands of the Guardians.

1. At the end of their journey, Artan has achieved a powerful bond with the Sacred Guardian Ara-Anu.  (and so becomes a sacred deity?)
[<triangle>, travel,    then   star, oneness, path]
Middle top:
Ara-Anu
2. Ara-Anu, accepts ???, and togetherness with the <people>?
[Accept, <u-shape>, star    then    prophet, oneness, path, <curly  C-ish?>]
Yeah, I know... it's a bit sketchy. Believe me when I say I have twisted this around in different directions before getting to this point, and think it will now benefit most from sharing for further thoughts.
Can anyone help?

I had another little breakthrough a few days ago.

This guy looks pretty pleased with himself, and here’s why.
That tablet he’s holding is a lot easier to decipher than the main tablet we use as a resource in the game.
The tablet he’s holding declares:
Column 1:
Old, Home, End, Fire, Kar-Kal
Column 1:
Ara-Anu, Command, Travel, Find,
<obscured by thumb!!>
Column 1:
Beginning, Build, Better, Home
As for the obscured rune, it could be path or dwell - both of which make sense - or some other rune I don’t know of.
So, very clearly: Kar-Kal destroyed the original home. Ara-Anu decreed that a new site was located and that a new better home was built.
This helps to reposition the Level-2 Temple-Tiles, which I’ll revisit in a later post, another time.
Whilst we’re talking tablets, here is the ‘main one’ used as a resource in the game - apologies for the grainy look:

As per my earlier post, it reads as follows:

Column 1. In the beginning, ???, ???, was opened.
[origin/beginning, ???, ???, Open]
Column 2. The prophet sees the path, all of the way.
[prophet, see, path, all]
Column 3. Find, ???, star, <broken tablet hides any further>
[find, ???, star, <broken tablet>]

There are at least three unknown runes there.  I’m also a little doubtful about the rune I’ve interpreted as ‘Open’ - that which is at the bottom of the left hand column.  The Open rune has slightly angled ‘walls’ and these are very straight.  That may not mean much, but it causes a little doubt.
Any ideas, anyone, about the three (or four) ‘unknown’ runes?
For convenience, here is Min’s ‘
Rosetta stone
’ again.

Very cool stuff, Paul! I wanted to take a shot at the main resource tablet that you had mostly deciphered (but note that I haven't read all of what you've done so far.)
In column one, it seems like the second glyph matches with the one that means high/noble. I cannot find anything on the third glyph, and my speculation is that it's a combo of stone and pray/worship - so maybe a temple of worship? Or some kind of high status home? The last glyph has to be open. I can't find anything else that would match the pi symbol. "In the beginning, the temple/stone place was opened" is my guess so far.
For column three, my best guess for the second glyph is "secret of". In Min's notes in the bottom right corner says a dot before a word = possessive/of (thanks google translate!). So my interpretation of the glyph is that it's a dot before the glyph for secret. "Find the secret of the stars" makes a lot of sense to me, at least!

Nice work Dan.
That seems to make a lot of sense.
It's been a while since I last posted here, but I have progressed my thinking a bit.  I'll repost when I get my thoughts together enough to provide a revised view.  I'll bear in mind your comments for that. Thanks!
Update: (05/04/2024) It's been a while since this last post. Life has been happening to me.
I will get back to it, but it'll be a while longer.

Hello guys
Then you "fight" with monster and cost you need to pay in transport can you exchange on 2 gold ?
like in this case

i need to pay card with plane 1 gold and 1 compass can i change on 3 gold and 1 compass ?

Yes!

Hello guys
Then you "fight" with monster and cost you need to pay in transport can you exchange on 2 gold ?

Yes, as the rules say on page 9 (box "Hiring a Pilot"), you can always pay 2 gold to have an airplane icon.

wrong. In LRoA, there is no fighting and no Monsters nor any looting of treasure.
You tame the Guardian.

wrong. In LRoA, there is no fighting and no Monsters nor any looting of treasure.
You tame the Guardian.

"Overcome," technically. Tame or befriend is the general idea, though - not kill.

Unless you have the revolver or the two handed sword
You might call it "intimidate" then though.

Fight. Tame. Intimidate. Overcome. It was funny that the creators were trying so hard not to make it a "battle", but to make it  "new-age" conciousness...I wont say Woke, but that triggers the opposite. But it was funny that they were trying so hard to say it was not "fighting" and for the Treasure track, it was not "looting" but "research/archiving/logging".

I take it as less new-age consciousness and more about not wanting part of the game to be about murdering animals. YMMV.
The whole point is that the 'boon' you get from the guardian is something the guardian is doing
for you.
Overcome a flying guardian and the boon is a plane icon? You're riding on the creature instead of paying for a plane. That doesn't really track if the guardian is dead.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not sure about playing the item. When playing an item, should I play the entire effect of the item, or can I only play part of it? (eg Sea Turtle, can I just draw a card but not use the effect to travel even if I have a free explorer and a place to travel to).

Yes. That’s optional

It's optional. On the last page of the rulebook in the icon index under the "Action Effects" section, it explains what the icon means.
"You MAY immediately take a Dig at a Site
or Discover a New Site action, if you have an
archaeologist on your player board. The effect may
specify special benefits or limitations"

Most of the good effects are optional, all the bad effects are mandatory.

Most of the good effects are optional, all the bad effects are mandatory.

Not necessarily. Some effects can be bad depending on the circumstances, e.g., if you don’t want to discard or exile a card. You may have to do so to get the card’s best benefit but it’s not mandatory.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Might be a stretch, but I'm based in the US and was trying to see if anyone happened to have an empty box of the game in good condition. I bought the game from someone recently and unfortunately the box is more worn than I was hoping. If you happen to have just the box, let me know!

Maybe the publisher sells it as separate part?

I think I still have my expansion box
Slightly smaller if I remember


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The effect is usually a set of icons. I understand that but the rules, also state that you must awaken a guardian right after. Is this a step that you must take, as well, when using "tent"?

No. Guardians only show up when exploring and revealing a new site.

The card text of the Tent item is:

Activate a site you occupy. If it is a [level II] site, you must first pay [compass][compass].

The keywords are "activate a site", which is explained on the backside of the rulebook:

Rulebook, page 24

activate a site:
When you activate a site, you use the site’s effect.

Nothing about placing a guardian tile here.
As Michael said, new guardians only show up when discovering a new site.

Thank you, all!

This question came up in a recent game because one player said that you are allowed to do this on the BGA implementation of Arnak. In this case, the player wanted to discover a new site, get an idol which had the "upgrade a tablet or arrowhead" bonus, slot the new idol to get two tablets, then upgrade a tablet to an arrowhead. They wanted to do this because they didn't have any other upgrade-able resources or a free idol to use before discovering the new site.
We didn't allow it because the rules state that you must resolve the idol bonus immediately (pg 10):

Take the idol. Immediately resolve the idol’s
effect. If the site has two idols, you take them
both, but use only the effect of the face-up one.
Keep your idols on your player board face down
on the illustrated supply crates

In our view, the last sentence seals it: the idols have to be face down when they are placed on your board, so you can never slot a face up idol.
I suspect this a bug with the BGA implementation, but I didn't see any bug reports concerning it, so now I'm wondering which is correct.

As you quoted:

Immediately resolve the idol’s
effect.

You forfeit the benefit otherwise.

As you quoted:

Immediately resolve the idol’s
effect.

I assume this is correct. Even though slotting an idol is a free action and as per the rulebook free actions can be played before, after, and even during your main turn. The term "immediately" trumps the term "during", right?

(Agreed that the rules pretty clearly imply that you cannot do this.)

How I see it, is that the effect of discovering a new site, where resolving the faceup idol is part of, first needs to be resolved completely before slotting an idol for it's effect. In your stated example it is not allowed to slot the idol in the middle of the discovering site effect. I think you're right by not allowing that to happen.

It
is
allowed to slot an idol during the Discover New Site main action; it's a free action and can be carried out before, during or after a main action as per the rules.  However, the issue is that the idol's printed effect is resolved immediately when you take it from the site.  By the time it arrives on your player board ready for slotting, its effect is deemed to have been resolved and it is now face down.  Therefore the tablets gained from the free action of slotting the face-down idol can't be used for the upgrade printed on the idol.

This is definitely not allowed, nor does BGA allow this.  I've played over 1000 games and never seen this is a bug, so I think this player was just remembering incorrectly.

I assume this is correct. Even though slotting an idol is a free action and as per the rulebook free actions can be played before, after, and even during your main turn. The term "immediately" trumps the term "during", right?

Eh. I wouldn't look too deep into the use of the word "immediately" here. Jason did an excellent job with the rules, and he (wisely) uses parlance in places to make the rules easier to read/understand, but this decision comes at the cost of making the rules less technical/precise when it comes to corner cases like this. You could remove the word "immediately" from the picture here entirely if you wanted. It's really only for clarity.
As for the actual ruling, with absolutely no evidence to back this claim up, I'm fairly certain you can't use a face-up idol you're in the process of currently obtaining to produce tablets for its own upgrade effect. That idol doesn't become usable until after you've finished resolving its effect and turned it face-down. You could use a completely different idol that you already had to produce the tablets for the upgrade though.
For me the real gray area is when you run into this same scenario except it's at a top site instead of a middle site. Could a player then use that site's face-down idol to satisfy the face-up idol's upgrade cost? Intuition has me leaning towards yes, but I'm genuinely unsure about that one.

At the top sites, you never gain the face down idols benefit.
It's
benefit is just as another idol.

Correct. You resolve the idol effect, then flip it face-down and place it (both of them) on the crates on your player board.
After placing them face-down on your player board, they are available to place them in idol slots.

No, you can't.

By the time it arrives on your player board ready for slotting, its effect is deemed to have been resolved and it is now face down.  Therefore the tablets gained from the free action of slotting the face-down idol can't be used for the upgrade printed on the idol.

My bad, I missed the part that it is also allowed to perform free actions
during
a main action. But yes, I also understand why this situation is still not allowed, because of the timing of using the idol for its face up effect and slotting effect.

I think that what could possibly happened here is that this player already had Idol on player board and used that idol to gain two tablets and then finished exploring new tile action. Difference is that he had 1 tablet prior to explore action and used that one and then used action from new one.

So I am curious about your experiences when playing with both expansions and all leaders combined?
Do you think the mechanic and the journalist fit well in this game when playing with the old leaders at the same time?

I think so, why are you concerned?
They seem like they were designed in a similar manner.
The biggest lack of fitting is physically in the box. They fit, but both new leader boards are long but not the same length, and spinning gear is a bit too short and just a bit too wide for another board to fit next to it.

So I am curious about your experiences when playing with both expansions and all leaders combined?
Do you think the mechanic and the journalist fit well in this game when playing with the old leaders at the same time?

If you are wondering if the newer leaders are overpowered compared to the older ones I don't think so.
Last game with my wife she played the Falconer and I played the Journalist, and we played on the waterfall temple. My wife won with 2 points more than me.

I like the Journalist. To get the most free stuff from his player board, you need to travel to as many unique sites as possible over the game. This is something no other leader needs to care about, so it brings on an interesting new challenge. I imagine it does make him more vulnerable to other player's coincidentally blocking him - they travel to a site they want, and it just so happens to be one the Journalist still wants to travel to. I like the article tokens acting as a psuedo idol. You can slot it in and get some stuff, but the stuff isn't as good or as flexible as the idol rewards.
I don't like the mechanic very much. I feel she is very inflexible, as the cog only spins one direction and you can never skip steps. You probably always want to make her monkey assistant golden, which I suppose means you can gain more fear and keep one of the assistants that are good at using fear (1 boot -> arrowhead, or draw a card and discard a card).
As far as power level goes though, both are probably close to on par with all the others.

Yeah I went into the 2nd expansion thinking the mechanic was going to be my favorite, being able to "build your engine literally and running it ( i am a mechanical designer, so that also helped). But I found it to be a bit limiting, while the journalist was very cool.
Slight chapter 1 spoiler:

Unfortunately I used the journalist in the first chapter of the campaign and between the travel symbols needed to pick up the articles and the travel symbols to push up the fog, i was running out of travel symbols!

Out of the 8! characters I think I like the money lady the most, having an airdrop every round is tactical but also really fun. I also had a lot of fun with the artifact guy, I really focused on playing to his strength and the game felt very different and that was really cool.
The journalist might be my 3rd favorite.

The only one I haven't seen in a game yet is the journalist.
Mechanic is strong, whilst others start with a card that is either a transport icon or a gold/compass in general, she gets both!
My favourite is the Falconer though - but she can be rough to use if you don't get compasses going fairly early I find.
On power level, all have won games that I have seen but the Professor and Mystic seem much tougher to get the best out of.

The Mystic and the Falconer are clear favourites over here (and mostly work well together in the campaign). The Mechanic and the Captain get picked every now and then. The Baroness and the Journalist are our least favourite by far.

On BGA I noticed when playing Decorate Horn I had the option to swap one of my assistants for the visible assistant in the middle of the research track (space that costs an unslotted idol).
Is this a legal move in IRL play, or just an unusual situation that was not programmed correctly?

As always when there is a rule question about a specific card... please tell us what exactly the card's text is. If you want others to help you, don't make them open their copy of the game and go though their entire stack of cards.

Decorated Horn reads, swap one of your assistants with one from the supply.  It comes to you with the same upgrade level and refreshed.
When you play the card on the snake temple on BGA, it highlights the kidnapped assistants as an option. I've never tried myself, and have also always been curious about the answer.

Thanks Andrew for adding that info. Here's a link to the image of Decorated Horn as well:
https://boardgamegeek.com/image/6142878/upurplay

The card "from the supply board." You'll need an official answer as to whether the temple track is considered part of the supply board. I would say it's not but I don't know.

I think that’s incorrect. The stack in the middle of the Snake temple is not on the supply board (page 2 of the rules lists the components). So if it’s really implemented that way, then it’s a bug.

Note that there's quite a few places where the BGA implementation of this game presents more apparently clickable locations than it should, but will then prevent you actually doing things against the rules. For example, I've definitely seen cards which allow relocating a placed archaelogist highlighting every site with an archaelogist to take from, even other players' - but if you select an opponent's, it'll in some way prevent you. If you only got as far as seeing the stack highlighted but didn't try taking from it, it might still not be actually allowed in the implementation.

Thanks for your responses everyone. That makes sense Simon!

I've started the Missing Expedition expansion and i quite like it, but I'm hoping to shrink it from 3 boxes to 2 or 1. Has anyone used the Folded Space insert for 1 or both expansions?

Folded space with the extra insert for expedition leaders doesn't fit missing expedition without a little lid lift. Just too many boards and the leader board with the spinner is an issue as it isn't flat. And tokens and cards will have to share spaces a bit as there isn't enough slots with both expansions.
I still use it for now, but a thinner 3D printed solutuon would be needed to fit them all in there without lid lift.

I have the Folded Space inserts - both the base game and the one for Leaders, which was pre-designed to fit in the base game - and have managed to squeeze all the multiplayer-usable content into the base game box with that, albeit with notable lid lift and a lot of careful rearrangement. That's with all the cards (single) sleeved except for the adventures.
I still have the Missing Expedition bozlx to hold the campaign guide, sheets, bonus red meeples, other campaign only tokens (pigeons, fog, temple rewards overlay) and the mission cards.
That said, I'm not convined if it adds value - the pre-trayed resource tokens are always nice but I'm not sure that it actually saves time unpacking the rest of it given the care it needs in re-packing all the tokens to make it work. Still looks nice, though.

I'm guessing they made a new version to incorporate more of the expansions.

I read the title quickly and thought this was a post about one of the exploration sites being in folded space, ha ha, searching for artifacts in the 4th dimension.  Lol.

I'm guessing they made a new version to incorporate more of the expansions.
https://www.miniaturemarket.com/box-insert-color-lost-ruins-...

Yes and no. There is a v2, but if you check on Folded Space's website it doesn't fit everything from the Missing Expedition and the guardians have to be split up. Still seems like a good solution. I'm currently looking at printing a 3d one, but my sleeves are larger than the print is designed for.

Do the Guardians have to be split up? I saw the Leader boards won't fit.

Not crazily split up, but they say "two guardian tiles, however the third will need to be placed with the level II site tiles "

It doesn't answer the folded insert question.
But I have all the multiplayer components(both expansions) in the big box and the campaign and solo components in the new expansion box.
I have a bunch of phone boxes and the like for the components.

What size sleeves do you use? Im currently in dragon shield and have had issues with fitting things
If you find/create a 3d printed one please let me know

Gamegenic. They were just a touch too long for the printed one that I was looking at. The maker had used Swan Premium, which are listed at 1mm shorter.

After years of having Arnak on my radar, but looking at it and being a bit intimidated, I finally watched a full playthrough and bought it. I got it to the table today for the first time for solo play.
I just wanted to clarify if I can continue taking turns and using main actions once the rival action stack is depleted in a round. In the final round I had a couple of cards remaining once the rival stack was depleted? I played them as if the rival had to pass each of their turns. Is this correct or do I have to stop once the rival stack is depleted?

Yes correct, as stated in the base game rules:

Rulebook, page 20

During the round, your rival and you alternate turns,
as you would in a two-player game
.

When your opponent in a 2 player game has passed, you keep on taking turns until you pass.
Same here with the Rival. If the Rival has taken their 10 turns, you keep on taking turns until you pass.

One comment regarding section I put in bold: once a player (real or solo) has passed their turn, they pass for the rest of the round. They cannot pass one turn, and later in the same round, play a new turn.
For solo, it will be kind of abvious since the stack is empty, but in games with real players, it may worth to precise it.

Of course, we all exile the Fear cards from our decks, but I was curious how many of you ever end up exiling the Funding and Exploration cards from your starting deck.  Has anyone found this to be a successful strategy, by creating a leaner deck of purchased Item cards?

Yes, of course I have done this. Especially in round 4. If want to increase my chances of drawing better cards.
I don't have any statistics though, if those attempts were successful.

I’m not so sure about your “of course”. When playing on the snake side, you’ll usually end up with several fear cards at game end.
Usually the other starting cards remain, but it’s not uncommon that a player trashes one.
(That said, a week or so ago I had a game in which I got rid of all starting cards. Torch was one of the reasons, defeating guardians that gave a trash was another. For most of the game I had 5 cards, one of which was Aeroplane, so that worked out nicely. But most of the time trashing any starting cards is more a consequence than a specific strategy.)

I’m not so sure about your “of course”. When playing on the snake side, you’ll usually end up with several fear cards at game end.

Pretty sure they meant that if you are going to exile something, Fear cards are the go to card to exile. You can't always exile everything, but if you have the choice, you do that.
To the OP, I have done that occasionally. Mainly because I might have a small deck and I want to make sure I get to my powerful cards more often.

I might trash one or two occasionally. More than that runs into difficulties with travel symbols. Using items for travel is often a loss in value.

It's almost always a weak play to try to make a thin deck in this game. There's just not enough time to thin your deck, then get rid of those exile cards, then fill the deck with strong cards. Just buy those strong cards - you'll get to use them 2-3 times over the game, sometimes 4 if you get a ton of card draw. Exiling fear is certainly nice, but not required to win by any means. There's ways to use the fear cards throughout the game aside from going to campsites. Likewise, your starting coin/compass cards will stay useful throughout the game as a car or boat, and you can almost always use more compasses.
Of course, it's better to exile one of these starting cards (+1 coin) than not if you've got an extra exile effect from the research track or something, though I would not use one of my guardian effects for that.

I never exile any starting cards except fear cards until I’m required to do so, then generally the immediate coin (though at the end I when I can’t do anything else and there is no cheap enough artifact card, I may choose the immediate compass card instead.

Of course, we all exile the Fear cards from our decks, but I was curious how many of you ever end up exiling the Funding and Exploration cards from your starting deck.  Has anyone found this to be a successful strategy, by creating a leaner deck of purchased Item cards?

On rare occasions I'll exile a single card. What my experience has taught me though is that exiling non-Fear cards generally isn't worth it for a few reasons.
1.) You need some way to travel, and if you exile all of your starting cards, then how will you do that? Best case scenario is that you've already purchased some junky artifacts that aren't worth replaying and can use those to fuel your archeologists. Anything else likely means you pay a hefty toll in terms of opportunity cost when it comes to dig/discovering sites.
2.) It's difficult to get that many exile effects in the first place.
3.) Even if you do find yourself with an abundance of exile effects, it's typically better to take on more Fear and then exile those than it is to exile your starting cards.

I almost never do, because when playing on the serpent temple you usually end up with more fear than you can handle.

I appropriately responded that I almost never exile any card but a fear card unless I’m required to do so (which, I then clarified, was when an artifact or item requires that the card br exiled in order to gain a benefit).
That is 100% accurate.

Yes, I understand what you were saying, and in my last post I literally answered you with "
you are right
".
I just stated that the self-exiling cards do not contribute to OP's question that was specifically about
exiling the Funding and Exploration cards from your starting deck
.
By the way you did not cite yourself correctly. You actually wrote:
"
I never exile any
starting cards
except fear cards until I’m required to do so
" (underlined by me)
That's why Michael answered that exiling is optional, because the topic is about the
starting cards
and you literally said "starting cards" as well. It was only afterwards when you brought the self-exiling cards into this topic...

I see your point. My original comment about exiling a non-fear card should have said “when I am forced to do so in order to get better cards back into my hand more quickly. And then there are the artifact and item cards that require exile in order to gain a particular benefit.”

I think people are getting stuck on the fact that you originally said "required to" and "forced to", when talking about exiling a choice of cards (like exiling starting hand cards, for example) is always just an option.
When you trigger an Exile icon, you MAY exile a card from your hand or play area.  you are never forced or required to.
But yes, if your aim as a player is to consistently draw better cards in subsequent turns, exiling the starting cards is kind of a "must" to achieve this once you've dealt with any Fear cards you may have in your play area or hand.
And I do not see any Artifact or Item cards in the base game that require the player to exile a card of his or her own choosing to gain a benefit or resource.

Make me love this game!
I am an enthusiast. I have SHELVES of games. We love heavy games, we love light games. We love resource management and deck building.
But we don't like Arnak!
I play exclusively two player with my spouse. We've played twice now. I get that it's interesting. I could see it being better at higher player counts.
Feels like the whole game is just - who can get up the tech track the quickest. Everything else focuses on that and what you need.
Also frustrating to build a deck where you'll only see most of good cards 1 time.
I've read reviews where people talk about the exploration element of this game. I don't feel like there is ANY exploration element. The theme and production value are awesome but I don't think the theme comes through in the gameplay. I don't care which sites I'm going to, I just care about the resources there. The tech tree has nothing to do with the theme, and that's the main focus.
I love the art, but the board is so busy and there are so many things on it I find it all get's lost.

First of all, you don't have to love this game. It's optional.
Secondly, Yes it is a resource management game with a nice veil of exploration. I personally find the exploration feel comes from: revealing new guardians, exploring new dig sites, and revealing new cards. I enjoy it for what it is and the puzzle and length don't outstay their welcome and everything feels pretty good. I like the variety of temple track vs deck building vs resource management vs worker placement. It has a little bit of everything like a charcuterie plate, but it's not a full meal. If you haven't tried any of the solo campaigns or used the expansion with Leaders, I highly recommend it.

I don't like it either. It is a one trick pony. I think there is too much emphasis on the track because of  the mountain of points toward the top. If one person goes a lot further than the others, that person wins. Game over.

It's not only racing up the track to get first but also exploring and defeating monsters, getting the right assistants for your strategy, buying the right cards for your strategy. And with the leaders expansion it becomes even more interesting because every leader asks a different strategy to follow.

That's not true, you can also win if you come in second place and have a lot of defeated monsters fe or you have a lot of extra points with the cards you bought.

It’s our favorite game. Also recommend you try it with

Not necessarily true. It’s the combination of that, scoring artifact and item cards, and idol and guardian VPs less fear cards plus any VPs left on your player board that are not used for idol bonuses. The most solid balance from resource management will win the game.

Make me love this game!

Love it... OR ELSE!!!

Feels like the whole game is just - who can get up the tech track the quickest. Everything else focuses on that and what you need.

I agree that advancing the research track is vital to getting a good score, but you definitely don't have to be the fastest to research, nor the first to the top.  I've played many games where I was second or third to find the lost temple and still won by having more guardians/idols/items/artifacts.  And on the other hand, I've also lost many times even though I was first to the top.

Also frustrating to build a deck where you'll only see most of good cards 1 time.

This game has a very minimal deck building element to it.  It's there but not heavily.  Don't expect it to be a deck building game and you won't be disappointed in that aspect.  It's focused more on worker placement and resource management.

I've read reviews where people talk about the exploration element of this game. I don't feel like there is ANY exploration element.

Arnak has an exploration "theme" but not much of an exploration mechanic.  I mean, the theme is like that of Indiana Jones and you're literally "exploring" a lost civilization on a rediscovered island full of ancient artifacts, mythical guardians and temples.  That's the theme.  The small amount of exploration that is part of gameplay is seen when digging at new sights to reveal new locations and guardians.  It's true, the main interest is exactly what resources are revealed there but that's what the game is.  If you're looking for a story driven type of thing, try the campaign that comes with The Missing Expedition expansion.  However, if you're looking for a dungeon crawl type of exploration mechanic, it's not there.

The theme and production value are awesome but I don't think the theme comes through in the gameplay. I don't care which sites I'm going to, I just care about the resources there.

You are probably very accurate with that statement.  The theme could probably be swapped out with something sci-fi, farming, medieval, etc.  I've even thought of creating a Legend of Zelda reskin, myself.
The resource management is indeed the main focus, in my opinion.  If that is not something you enjoy, then perhaps this game is not for you.  While the theme is just a skin for the game, I do enjoy it quite a bit.  It's only delicately laid over the game mechanics but that allows me to interpret things in a fun way.  Like, for example, how a guardian may give me a Jeep travel icon.  I humorously interpret that to mean that the beast gives me a ride to the next location I wish to travel.

The tech tree has nothing to do with the theme, and that's the main focus.

It's a research track that represents discovering and recording clues that lead me to the lost temple.

I love the art, but the board is so busy and there are so many things on it I find it all get's lost.

The first time I looked at this game, this is how I felt and skipped over looking anymore into it for a long time.  Once I did go back and become familiar with it, this was no longer an issue.  Now I only see an island filled with mystery and much to be discovered.  Fear grips my heart but perhaps I can use that to push forward through the jungle, making my way up the twisting river and perhaps hire a pilot brave enough to fly me to the top of that plateau where I just know I might find some antient ruins.  But I just created that in my head.  I know it's only about converting green tokens into fancy plastic tablets, arrowheads, and gems all in an effort to gather some rectangular 11 and 6 point cardboard tokens in the end.
It may be that this game is just not for you, and that is perfectly fine.  Play it several more times and see how you feel.  If you still don't enjoy it, maybe sell it, trade it, give it away and find something that fits your style more.  I'm not sure that anyone can make you love it.  Love just comes naturally.

It is true. playing a game where 1 player get all the way to the top and nobody else gets more than halfway and see who wins.

It is true. playing a game where 1 player get all the way to the top and nobody else gets more than halfway and see who wins.

I've won without advancing more than halfway up the research track - or just enough to get both assistants. BUT I also overcame something like 9 guardians, and the research-track player hadn't overcome any.

Have you tried the snake temple? Moving up there is more difficult, so it may feel more balanced with the other scoring categories.

I play exclusively two player with my spouse. We've played twice now. I get that it's interesting. I could see it being better at higher player counts.
Feels like the whole game is just - who can get up the tech track the quickest. Everything else focuses on that and what you need.
Also frustrating to build a deck where you'll only see most of good cards 1 time.
I've read reviews where people talk about the exploration element of this game. I don't feel like there is ANY exploration element. The theme and production value are awesome but I don't think the theme comes through in the gameplay. I don't care which sites I'm going to, I just care about the resources there. The tech tree has nothing to do with the theme, and that's the main focus.
I love the art, but the board is so busy and there are so many things on it I find it all get's lost.

Maybe if you reset your expectations?
The research track is important, but as someone mentioned you don't *need* to be the quickest, sometimes it is better to be more efficient with your resource gathering and using such that you earn the most and spend the least in order to get up the track. Being able to do more things (buying cards, exploring, etc.) could mean that you move up the track slower but you are earning more ancillary points. This is a skill, learning how to coordinate your actions, to take better advantage of the worker spots, exploration sites, cards on display, and your leader's special abilities than your opponent. It's fun to learn a skill! Try playing against more skilled opponents and you will possibly realize that there is more to the track than "be the quickest" or maybe not, I am not that skilled
This is a light deck building game and you noticed already that you don't use your cards over and over again like in other deck building games. This is good, and interesting, because in many other deck building games your turns are pre-destined. There is one way to use all your cards and in one order to be the most useful, and you play all your cards each turn, and the only decision you make that is not set in stone is which cards you buy. In this game, the skill is in using the cards you have available in each turn to make the most efficient and useful resource trades. This means you have many choices: should I use my boots to explore, should I use my cards to get compasses, or arrowheads, or gems, should I try and get one of the assistants before my opponent, should I lock up an action slot before they get to it? Many choices, much more than many deck building games!
As someone mentioned the theme is the skin on top of this medium-weight euro game. The card display and card draw add a light randomization element which you can totally mitigate through card draw or planning which cards you purchase and in which order. The theme is discovering ancient artifacts, buying exploration equipment and vehicles, uncovering ancient temples, and discovering clues (tablets, arrowheadss, gems, etc.) that teach you more about these ruins (the research track) and the one that is the most knowledgeable at the end is the winner.
Check out heavy euro games if you want to see what kind of madness the board *could* look like (Feast for Odin, Lacerda games, etc.). At least here the board is organized sequentially: Base Camps, Close exploration, Far exploration, market. On the side is the research track which spans the whole board.
So maybe you can tune out what you expect this game to be, and focus on what the game is: a hybrid of worker placement and deck building with a light theme. The theme, take it or leave it, is fun to see how they mechanically tie it together: Give items to appease the guardians, the airdrop card lets you get an item for free, the army knife allows you to get one of any token, coffee gives you ability to explore further and some extra uses out of your assistant, etc.
If you focus on what the game is, and you don't like it, that's fine too. It is sort of light to medium weight, but some people want more thematic actions so that you feel like an explorer, and some people want heavier euro mechanics, some people want no theme on their euros (weird to me), and some people can tolerate no randomness in their games. Maybe that's you!

We love Imperium (Classics, Legends), Ark Nova, Dwellings of Eldervale, Mystic Vale, Point Salad, Nations, Tiny Towns.

If you only focus to get all the way to the top for getting the most points there, I understand why you don't like the game. It's certainly good to get to the top and grab some points there but that's not the only thing to focus on and that's also not the only way of winning the game. It's more than that. You have to explore to get resources. You have to kill monsters, not only for their points but also to use their ability in an efficient way. You have to buy the right cards, not only because cards are points but also because they give you resources and abilities. You have to find combos with the cards. You have to consider how many cards you will buy and which cards you buy, artifacts or items. You have to focus on good assistants that fit in your strategy. You have to put your idols in the slots on the right moment. You have to focus on the resources of the others players so you know which worker placement spots are the most urgent for you to take. It's not about getting the highest on the track but it's about doing the resource management, the worker placement, the deckbuilding and the racing part in the best possible way. If you kill 10 monsters, that's 50 points, and if you also get a lot of points from your cards, than you don't have to go all the way to the top of the track to get enough points to win. Climbing on the track is the easiest strategy but not the only strategy in the game. This game is definitely not a one trick pony.

I don't like it either. It is a one trick pony. I think there is too much emphasis on the track because of  the mountain of points toward the top. If one person goes a lot further than the others, that person wins. Game over.

That's not true, you can also win if you come in second place and have a lot of defeated monsters fe or you have a lot of extra points with the cards you bought.

It is true. playing a game where 1 player get all the way to the top and nobody else gets more than halfway and see who wins.

It depends on how many points the other player has scored with his monsters, with his artifacts, with his items and with his Idols. It also depends on how far that player has moved on the track with his other token.

Make me love this game!

Sure, I'll try.

I am an enthusiast. I have SHELVES of games. We love heavy games, we love light games. We love resource management and deck building.
But we don't like Arnak!

In my experience, the enjoyment of many things is often tied to peoples' expectations of them. For example, say you’re indulging in caviar, or at least you would consider it to be indulging if it weren’t for the fact that this particular caviar happens to taste exactly like rainbow sherbet. Now, you love rainbow sherbet. And you love caviar too. But when you discover that your caviar tastes exactly like rainbow sherbet, you find the experience unpleasant. Why? Because of expectations. I can't say whether or not this is applicable to you personally, but I thought it might be worthwhile mentioning anyway.

I play exclusively two player with my spouse. We've played twice now. I get that it's interesting. I could see it being better at higher player counts.

My understanding is that the popular consensus for Arnak is that it plays best with 3 players. I've played a lot of 2-player games though, and I'd go as far as to say that Arnak plays just as well with 2 players as it does 3 players, if not slightly better. 4-player games are a different animal altogether though. While still palatable, my experience has been that 4-player games tend to constrain each person's options too severely and leads to a less pleasant game overall. And what I've heard from other people tends to affirm this. So, while maybe you will find 3-player games to be more to your liking, I suspect that higher player counts won't increase your enjoyment of the game as much as you might hope it to.

Feels like the whole game is just - who can get up the tech track the quickest. Everything else focuses on that and what you need.

Funny enough, ascending the research track too quickly is often a tell that someone is doing poorly. (This is usually because said player is researching with their magnifying glass exclusively and missing out on the more valuable rewards that the notebook typically bestows. And when that isn't the case, moving up the research track fast with both tokens is often indicative of misappropriating resources that would have been better spent elsewhere.)
The research track isn't a race. Yes, you want to be the first person to the top. Yes, you also want to maybe be the first person to reach certain thresholds so that you can claim dibs on a specific assistant or bonus research tile or whatever before your opponents do. From a strategic perspective though, those elements shouldn't make you want to ascend the research track as fast as humanly possible at all costs. Other aspects of the game need your consideration too. And everything costs resources.
If I were you, I would consider the research track to be your primary mechanism for scoring points. While there are obviously several different avenues in which you can (and will) accumulate points, Arnak isn't the kind of game where you can largely ignore one avenue in the sole pursuit of another. You can't just go, okay, this game I'm going to focus exclusively on discovering sites, collecting idols, and overcoming guardians to the detriment of everything else. Point-wise, that would be a disaster. To be successful, you must instead learn how to take a balanced approach to all the different elements in the game.

Also frustrating to build a deck where you'll only see most of good cards 1 time.

There's a lot I could say about this. I'm not sure where to begin.
When my brother and I were learning how to play Arnak together for the first time, we had feelings similar to yours. The two of us each felt let down by the game initially because we felt as though the deckbuilding aspect of the game wasn't as prominent as we were expecting it to be. We were also disappointed in that we found the game was over just when we were finally able to cobble together a deck of cards that we thought was fun and exciting.
In time, we got better at the game though, and what we learned is that the deckbuilding aspect of Arnak is quite important. When we're playing well, our decks commonly become well-oiled machines. We often find ways to draw every card in our deck each round and then some, requiring us to purchase additional items in order to not waste additional card draw opportunities available to us. And while we don't always see all of our cards each round, especially if we end up bloating our deck full of artifacts before the start of the fifth round, but we usually find ways to see most of them. So if you're frustrated that you aren't seeing items you've purchased as often as you would like, there's a chance your feelings about this could change as you become more experienced.

I've read reviews where people talk about the exploration element of this game. I don't feel like there is ANY exploration element. The theme and production value are awesome but I don't think the theme comes through in the gameplay. I don't care which sites I'm going to, I just care about the resources there. The tech tree has nothing to do with the theme, and that's the main focus.

Yeah, I would agree with that. The Indiana Jones-esque theme is just that: a theme. It's a fun theme, but the game wouldn't play any different if it had a different coat of paint.

I love the art, but the board is so busy and there are so many things on it I find it all get's lost.

I don't think I ever had this problem myself, so perhaps none of this will be useful, but the big picture overview of Arnak is that there's really only three things going on. You've got the card row, the site area, and the research track.
This is general advice lacking nuance, but give the site area and the research track most of your attention. Try to discover any sites early into the round rather than later so you have the most time to figure out how to adapt to the site and guardian you encounter. Don't neglect purchasing items, but it's usually safe to wait until the end of the round before buying anything to ensure you don't accidentally overspend early in the round and find yourself up a creek later.

I'm with OP.  This is too generic of a resource management game to spark my interest.  I've played it 2 or 3 times, but I just can't bring myself to get it to the table again.  It's not bad, it just doesn't spark joy in me.  It's probably me more than the game, because it's got lots of fans.  I keep it in my collection, though, hoping one day I might change my mind.

Before giving up on the game, you should try the free solo-campaign through the web-app. You could both sit at the table and discuss what to do.
If you like the way the devs use the mechanics to tell a story, perhaps the new coop expedition-expansion would be another way to enjoy the game?
I haven't tried the new expansion, but I'm in the process of running through the solo campaign and find it enjoyable in a very different way than the base game.
I do like the base game even if I tend to forget the theme and focus too much on the resources during play. But I hope they do a lot more campaigns too. It makes the theme feel much stronger.

Make me love this game!

Buy the expansions. Get a wooden insert. Scour Etsy for all the upgraded components you can find. Rationalize that because you've spent so much money on the game you must in fact love it.
That's always an option if the gameplay just isn't doing it for you.

You already got lots of comments, so I'll write mine in short form.
1. Not every game is for everyone, it's OK not to like this one (even though I love it).
2.Snake temple is a lot more interesting.
3. Now that you are playing on skae temple, let's see you get 90+ points without exploring and defeating guardians.
4. This game is better at 3 players then at 2.
Good luck

Also frustrating to build a deck where you'll only see most of good cards 1 time.

In my best games, I tend to have no more than ten cards in my deck, then I know exactly which cards will be available in the next round.  On one or two occasions, admittedly with some good fortune, I have been able to use a first-round item purchase in all four of the later rounds.
Don't make the mistake of thinking that a big deck with lots of good cards in it is a good deck.

Feels like the whole game is just - who can get up the tech track the quickest. Everything else focuses on that and what you need.

How many points do you get from racing up the "tech track" in one of your games?  What happens when you get to the top in round 3 or 4?  What do you do after that?  How many points could you have obtained from collecting idols (3 points each) and from defeating guardians (5 points each)?

I don't like it either. It is a one trick pony. I think there is too much emphasis on the track because of  the mountain of points toward the top. If one person goes a lot further than the others, that person wins. Game over.

That's not true, you can also win if you come in second place and have a lot of defeated monsters fe or you have a lot of extra points with the cards you bought.

Most of our games are won by players that get second or third to the top. You can not let you be very far from the top, but the rest of what you do is what gets you the final edge. I usually see that who wins is the one that defeated most guardians.

Definitely a case of resetting your expectations. This is a simple game that has a nice puzzle and gives any players a buzz when fun combos pop up and you can extend your turn. And the artwork is lovely.
But yes, it is essentially a race up the track (though not exclusively).
Not every game is for everyone, I'm not sure why you want to like it so much. You aren't missing out on anything and the people who enjoy the game just have different preferences to you.

Hi everyone, we need your help.
So, everyone gets two archaeologists to explore.
once you place them on the board to rent locations, can you travel further within the same round?
go from tent to | location and from | to || location within 1 round?

No. Unless you have a card which enables movement those are the only placements you can make.

Hi everyone, we need your help.

Not by normal actions, unless a special card action explicitly lets you. When you explore or discover, the rules clearly say that the archaeologist comes from your player board, not from a site on the main board.

In general once an archeologist is at a location it's going to stay there, but there are a fair number of cards that will let you move them around. There's probably more in the expansions, but I only know the base game.

The nature of the game is very much that you will be fairly limited in what you can do in the first round. Place both archaeologists on campsites, maybe do a research or buy a card, etc. But in each successive round you will find you can do more and more.

If you buy the

expansion, The Captain provides you with a third archaeologist  (at the expense of a very bad extra fear card)…

I wonder how useful it is. Occasionally it is tricky to get the travel icons needed for just two workers, a third might often mean spending a useful card for travel. And the consolation space on the player board is less valuable than most of the camp sites, so this is not great either.

Depends on the cards you buy and whether you’re able to add cards, but that’s why you have the option of using the extra one to get the beneift of any of the three visible unchosen  assistants…

I just started a solo game today. I have the same question. Is it an item card with a meeple saying two boots discount ?

A two boots discount card would help you get to Level II and in some cases tame a Guardian. You still cannot move an archaeologist who already explored (unless you have a card that expressly so states).

Wow.  I've been playing this totally wrong.  I've been moving my archeologists around from location to location on subsequent turns just by paying the travel cost.
No wonder I found it easy to avoid getting fear cards from guardians.

Note that the rules for digging at a site (page 9) explicitly say "Move your archaeologist
from your player board
to that space." Similarly for discovering a site (page 10) "move your archaeologist
from your board
to that site's space".
(emphasis added by me)

Oh I definitely blame myself.  I had only skimmed the rules.  But going back and actually reading, there's an even less ambiguous line on Page 9

Note: If both your archeologists are already on sites, you cannot take this action.

Can't get much clearer than that, but I had just completely missed that part.
and just to clarify, it's not like I've been playing this game wrong for years..  I just got this game last week and had only played twice.
And I admittedly was going off of my own assumption that moving around the board is like the cheapest easiest action to do.  you just need to pay travel costs.  And it's the first action listed.  and in a lot of other games a movement action can be selected for how ever many times you can "afford" to use it on a turn. So yeah, facepalm.  I'm the one with the egg on my face.  I am trying a solo round now and yeah..  that rules clarification changes my tactics considerably, lol.

For those who are interested, here is how I store the base game and both expansions into the one main box.    I used the
Super Deluxe Tuckbox Template Maker
to create 3 deck boxes for the cards and 2
Tool Bench Hardware Storage Cases
from the Dollar Tree for most of the tokens and such (These appear to have been replaced with a product of different dimensions.  The ones that I used look like these

Tool Bench Hardware Storage Cases

).  Also included is the print and play
Solo Mini Expansion
that has the purple difficulty Rival cards, as well as a black bag for randomly drawing tokens.





I may try this myself. Do you have your cards sleeved? I'm not from the USA though, so I will try to find similar cases on AliExpress or something.

I may try this myself. Do you have your cards sleeved? I'm not from the USA though, so I will try to find similar cases on AliExpress or something.

No.  My cards are not sleeved.  I wouldn't know how much thicker the decks would be if they were.  A couple of my deck boxes did have a little extra space to spare.  Good luck finding similar cases!

This didn't work for me. The boxes linked must be twice as tall as what you used, they also have different dividers. They are not symmetric.

This didn't work for me. The boxes linked must be twice as tall as what you used, they also have different dividers. They are not symmetric.

You are correct.  It looks like the Dollar Tree has updated their product to a newer model with different dimensions.  What it used to look like, and the ones that I used, were like these:
https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Bench-Hardware-9-Compartment-Pla...
, but those are 4 times as much as what I paid.  Here's another photo:

Tool Bench Hardware Storage Cases

I'm sorry for the inconvenience and hope you can find a solution that works for you.  I'll amend my original post.  Also, I'll have to see if I can purchase any remaining old model cases at the Dollar Tree before they all disappear, as I like the lower profile of those, and have been using them with many of my other board games.
Thank you for pointing this out.

This is the best insert for Arnak with all expansion so far. Setup and teardown of game under 5 minutes. Priced for 25 EUR only. Unfortunately, web is in Czech.
https://www.insertyherman.cz/product/insert-arnak-lidri/

I gave that Amazon link a shot and I received the same ones I got from the dollar store.

This is my solution:
- matchboxes for the tiny tokens
- token crates out of popsicle sticks
- smaller boxes made from the expansion boxes





I gave that Amazon link a shot and I received the same ones I got from the dollar store.

That's unfortunate.  If you are not able to use those cases you should ask for a refund, as those are clearly not what is shown in the picture on the Amazon site.
Thanks for the heads up as I was considering ordering those as well since they are discontinued in the Dollar Tree stores.

This is my solution:

Excellent solution!  I think it's cool that you were able to repurpose the expansion boxes.  I assume that all the large temple and player boards are there, as I could only see a couple of the leader boards in the pictures.

I've been playing chapter six without research bonus tiles however I haven't found in the rulebook where it says there are no tiles. It does say there are no temple tiles for points and also the image shows the track without the bonus tiles, but I'm wondering whether people here think the image is wrong or the rulebook is missing a rule (or maybe I just can't see it).

Hello.  I have access to a laser cutter and was wondering if there are any organizer plans available for download that accommodates the core and both expansions.

What laser printer do you own and what kind of wood/material do you use for inserts?

Both expansions? No. Not that I've seen. I have eRaptor's insert which works for the first expansion. I have a 3D printer and print plenty of inserts but haven't found one for both expansions. I doubt it's possible, at least practically. You could cram everything in the box, but having a functional insert that facilitates putting the game on the table? Doubtful.

When playing the Torch card as an action - for its exile ability, can this be used on the same Torch card itself as it is now in the play area? If so, Do you still take a stone tablet as the second part of the ability?
Tried searching this forum and google…
Thanks in advance!

You can exile cards from your hand as well, see page 13 of the rulebook.
By the way, in the chapter "to play a card" in the rulebook, it is not mentioned if you have to follow a specific order of the effects, if a card has more than one. (I am talking about main actions.)
So I assume you can choose the order and therefore it should be possible to get the tablet and then exile the card.

It would seem to me that a torch burning out (being exiled) is thematically sound.  Neither would I stop you taking the tablet (as caught by the dying light).

When playing the Torch card as an action - for its exile ability, can this be used on the same Torch card itself as it is now in the play area? If so, Do you still take a stone tablet as the second part of the ability?

In the rulebook, page 13, under "Play a Card" you have this:

To Play a Card
1.
Play the card
from your hand face up into your play area
2.
Resolve the card's effect

So, to use the torch you must first put it into your play area. Now you can resolve the effects: exile a card.
In the same page, under "Exile":

...you may
exile a card from your hand or from your play area

So you can exile the torch you just play to get the tablet
Note: Emphasis are in the rulebook

Thanks all - this was my interpretation too, but as it benefited me and not my playing partners (who were playing for only the second time) I wanted to check my reasoning was sound
Much appreciated

Thanks all - this was my interpretation too, but as it benefited me and not my playing partners (who were playing for only the second time) I wanted to check my reasoning was sound
Much appreciated

Why did you want to exile it?

To get down to a certain number of cards for the last round (6 in this case as had a draw one card ability) - thus guaranteeing re-drawing all my artifacts and items which I needed
