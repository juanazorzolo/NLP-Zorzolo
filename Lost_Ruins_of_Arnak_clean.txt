GAME BOARD SELECTION & SETUP 
The Bird Temple main board is for beginners 
The Snake Temple for experienced players 
•Research track setup: Deal 1 random assistant per player 
•The regular assistant stacks will now have two stacks of 4 and one stack 
of whatever remains (3/4/5) 
•To advance a research token to this tier, you must Cirst pay 1 non-slotted idol 
•Then privately choose 1 of the assistants here, returning the stack in 
the same order when you're Cinished 
•This newly "rescued" assistant is not available until refreshed 
(at round end or through some other effect) 
The Monkey/Lizard Temple research track overlays are for experienced players 
•Use the Snake Temple main board when playing for these overlays 
•You can research for 2/6-point temple tiles before reaching the top tier 
Monkey Temple setup: Deal a random face-up artifact with a 3-compass cost 
•Your magnifying glass activates it (for free) when reaching this tier 
•But the artifact is left in place for the other players to activate it later 
Lizard Temple setup: Deal a random face-down guardian 
•It is turned face-up the Cirst time someone's magnifying glass reaches it 
•No research token may move beyond it until it has been overcome 
•It is overcome as with normal guardians, and it will give you 1 fear per 
research token present at the end of the round (max 2 fear) 
•Also, for tier 6: Place the 4 leftover idols facedown nearby 
•When your notebook reaches this tier, activate any discovered, 
unoccupied level I site, then trash it and any associated guardian

now be "discovered" all over again 
•Left side of tier 6: Pay 1 non-slotted idol (+ 2 tablets) to advance to here

GAMEPLAY 
Card Management: 
•Draw until you have 5 cards in hand (at the start of each round) 
•Newly acquired: 
•Fear cards go into your play area (not into your hand) 
•Artifact cards are played immediately, and you don't pay a tablet 
•When you play the artifacts again later, you must pay a tablet 
•Item cards go under your deck, hopefully to be drawn next round 
•If your deck runs out of cards mid-round, you are simply out of cards; don't 
shufWle cards in your play area into a new deck 
•There is no discard pile 
•At the end of each round, shufCle all played cards and put them under 
your deck 
•Any cards remaining in hand (e.g. fear) can either be shufCled in 
with the played cards, or kept in your hand for next round 
•Before moving the moon staff at round end, exile (trash) 1 card on both sides of 
the blue staff (2 cards on both side of the red staff) 
Discovering New Sites: 
•The compass cost is only paid once, by the discoverer of a new site 
•There is no compass cost when subsequent archeologists action said site 
•Always take the idol bonuses before the new site's bonuses (and take the new 
site's bonuses before revealing the guardian 
•i.e. idol bonuses of up-trading/exiling cannot apply to tablets/
arrowheads/fear generated by the site tile 
Research Tracks: 
•Your notebook can never move above your magnifying glass 
•Notebooks do trigger bonus tiles (allowing you to potentially beneCit 
twice from the same stack of bonus tiles) 
•When you upgrade an assistant from silver to gold, immediately refresh that 
assistant (allowing it to be used twice in the same round) 
•When you arrive at multiple research bonus tiles: 
•In a stack, you may look at them all and choose 1 
•In a row, you choose 1 blindly and don't get to see the others 
General Gameplay: 
•Travel costs must be paid every time an archeologist moves to an action space 
•2 coins may be used to cover any single travel cost 
•Planes pay for anything, buggies/boats pay for themselves or boots 
•When you exile (trash) a card, you can choose from any that you've already 
played (ideally), or from those still in your hand 
•When a card is bought from the card row, immediately slide/reWill the row 
•'Lightning' icons are free actions, which don't count as your turn's main action 
•Some cards will provide free actions, others main actions 
•A few cards provide a free action "and then" a main action 
•For the Expedition Leaders, blue idol slots are required to activate the 
leaders unique (blue) effect; Slots may be activated in any order
